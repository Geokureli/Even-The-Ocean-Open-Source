// USAGE:
// Ctrl-F the entity name
// F = float, I = int, S = string.


// It's best practice to add a PRESET if you wish to use an entity a lot, rather than
// hand editing many.

// Hand editing is primarily for tweaking something in game.

*****

VIS-DMG  should be a comma-separated number list : "1,1". Dmgtype is almost always 0 or 1, 0 = dark damage, 1 = light damage.
VIS is the Visual Type of the entity, generally this is 0 for the default dark and 1 for the default light spritesheet, but if you edit the misc/entity_spritesheets.son file of the game you can add other spritesheets

--- Dasher
	- behavior is rough. hurts on contact
	- dashes wen you're in its line of sight. i need to refine this since the vertical space at which it detects you is off
	
	--- is_vert = goes up and down rather than left/right. not implemented 
	
--- LaunchBug
	- either jumps between ceiling and floor or left and right walls. will track the player. hurts with contact damage. nonsolid.
	- is_hor = 1 means will jump between left andr ight walls
		- is_left = starts on the left wall (i.e., will begin with tracking the player vertically while on al eft wall). only applies
			when is_hor = 1. if is_left = 0 then you should start the LaunchBug on a right wall.
		- is_up - same concept but with floor/ceiling
	- y/x vel refer to how fast it travels on a wall
	- launchvel - how fast it launches from wall to wall

--- SquishBounce
	p.set("vis-dmg", "0,0");
		dmgtype doesn't do anything, vistype can be used to change if you dont use GNPC_ID for the anim
		
	p.set("max_jump_multiplier", 1.4);
		Default, you can reach 4 blocks high at neutral energy
		
	p.set("initintovel", 53);
		How fast the bouncer moves downwards Initial
		
	p.set("outaccel", -280);
		Acceleration applied to bouncer when it is moving downwards
		
	p.set("is_cloud", 0);
		If = 1, then this is not collidable except when jumping on top
		
	p.set("GNPC_ID", "");
		If set to a valid Generic NPC ID, then it will be loaded
		
	p.set("x_slow",-1);
		If set to >0 then your velocity X is this when walking on top

	p.set("chasevel", 150);
		how fast it can follow you
	p.set("tm_allow_damage", 1.5);
		a timer that resets when you get hurt, after it decrements all the way you can be hurt again
	p.set("dmg_amt", 32);

--- WallBouncer 
	*** MUST BE INSIDE OF A WALL TO WORK 
			p.set("vis-dmg", "0,0");
			// see climbspore
		p.set("climb_vel", 60
		// how fast it folllws you );
--- WaterGlider
	- If you jump on it, it launches on direction you are facing at 	velocity 'vel' with drag.x '5' 
	- Does sap damage when touching
*********
***npc***
*********

--- Cauliflower
	- Always does contact sap damage
	- max_babies/nr_stalks/tm_shoot/tm_regrowth don't do anything yet 
		- max babies - supposed to shoot out spores that grow into explodable cauliflower
		- tm_shoot = latency for launching a new set of babies
		- tm_regrowth - i'm not sure
		- nr_stalks = number of stalk sprites connecting a floating caulilower to the ground
	- is_self_aware 
		--- if = 1, then it floats in air. stalk sprites anchor to ground. if you wall jump on it, it goes left/right. if yuo jump on it, then its x velocity matches the contact x velocity of the player, and it also moves downward
		---- if = 0, it is stationary with no stalk	

--- Mole
	- init-energy = energy it starts with 
	- max-energy - max energy (on scale of 0 to max_energy )
	- vel_bounds - string, format "xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax" for velocities. energy clsoer to 0 = x veloicity closer to xmax. enrgy closer to max_energy = y velocity closer to ymax.
	-turns_right = does this turn right when hitting a wall
	- init-dir - does this start up/right/down/left
	
--- Pendulum
	add it under Pendulum's entry in entity_spritesheets.son (because Pendulum is it's own dedicated entity, not a GenericNPC)
 
you can actually just combine the spritesheets since what will be indexing into them is just the sets of animations in animations.txt . might be best this way since the sprites are small so easier to manage. just make sure they're separated in 32x32 px chunks
 
 
in-editor, "vine_set" will load up the corrresponding entry in entity_Spritesheets.son's Pendulum entry - so "TEST" will load vine_TEST, etc. 
 
when you add a new one to Pendulum in this metadata file just copy paste everything but change the anim_set. anim_set corresponds to the animation set in animations.txt  that is also under Pendulum.
 
so in this case vine_TEST also has a corresponding animation set vine_TEST which is where the randomized leaves are pulled from. right now the bottom-thing on a vine/pendulum is determined by "anim_name". this will play that animation from the animation set vine_TEST so it's possible the randomized sprites on the vine will look like the bottom one. I can make it so that the bottom thing pulls from a different animation set, though.

--- SetPiece
	- Search "SetPiece" in generic_npc.son

--- WirePoint
	- When sent a message from a sappad, this will send an animation of sparkes to its first child. 
	- combine with whatever tile to make this look okay
	
*********
***util**
*********
--- BubbleSwitch   
	- behavior must = vistype for normal default vistypes 0,1,2 (dark, light, both)
--- Button
	- Depending on vistype, when touched, sends a single energy point tick message to its children.
	- One-time press.

--- Elevator
	- the grey boxes are 'consoles' - if the elevator is away from the console and you interact w/ the console then the elevator gets caleld up or down
	- youc an chidl elevators to eachoher so that if you move one it moves the other one
	- if youre standing on an elevator andi nteract, it goes up or down, they collide as clouds
	
--- LineCollider

	- there's a free redbox to the right of the last pt on a segment. click and drag to add a new segment

- click and drag any red box to move it, except for the first (need to ctrl+click)

- hold ctrl while dragging to snap to grid

- pts won't move in y-direction till you move a certain threshold

** a pt should always stay between (with respect to the x axis) the pts next to it - otherwise collisions dont work

* like deliting an entity, holding D and clicking a red box deletes that pt from the line collider. unless it's the left-most box then the entire thing gets deleted

--- RaiseWall
	p.set("needed_en", 64); Energy to open gate
	p.set("energy", 0); Energy it starts with
	p.set("vistype", VIS_DARK_DEBUG); What it looks like / its energy behavio
	
	p.set("s_open", 0); Is it open
	p.set("permanent_open", 0); should it stay open through saves/moving maps
	init_state - if set to -1, then this raisewall's state will be saved throughout the whel game
	
	p.set("is_wide", 0);  is it wide
	p.set("raise_dir", 0); what direction does it raise
	p.set("raise_distance", 32); how far does it raise
	
--- SoundZone
	[wall type] / [floor type] (modify mode)
 
where modify mode = both, wall, floor
 
if you shift+click in the parenthesis it changes the modify mode
 
if you shift+click on the types, you get the normal drag-down list. the difference being in 'both' mode both types change to what u select, or just one of them if in the other modes
 
	
--- Stopper
	- This sends a single energize tick message to its children when it touches a sink platform. 
	- It also sends a Stop message to anything it touches - right now only sinkplatforms. this causes the thing touching it to
		snap its position to the stopper
--- VanishBlock
		p.set("vistype", VIS_DEBUG_DARK); // energy type needed to open
		p.set("s_open", 0); // whether it's open or not right now  
		p.set("perma_open", 0); // whether it stays open after a save or leaving the map
		
		// Gauntlet Variables
		p.set("leg", -1);  // what leg it's on if needed
		p.set("post_leg", 0); // what it should be after the leg is finished
		p.set("pre_leg", 0); // whta it should be before the leg iss tarted

	I nrenter - number of green, entrance triggers (which trigger this camera lock)
	I nrexit - "" but for exit

	AUTO_INDEX: DONT CHANGE THIS
	index ; What index door in the next map itll go to. leave at -1 to use dest_x dest_y instead.

	dest_y : 
	next_cam_offset : format - float,float (e.g. 4,4 ) : offset the camera from centered around the player in the next map (if posible
	script : path to script which can change behavior of where this door goes or if it is active
	type - Visual type - 0 (DEBUG)
