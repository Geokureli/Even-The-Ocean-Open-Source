// Tunnel_1 -> Tunnel_2 -> tunnel_3 -> tunnel_4 -> MAP2 -> KV_1 -> KV_RADIO -> (KV_BED, KV_OFFICE) (SCREEN AREAS) maybe KV_RADIO is screen/...?

// Blockers:
// x Tunnel_3 - If just got to KV and before final debrief, can't use it
// x Tunnel_1 - door requires keycard (script on door)
// x Can't go anywhere except KV_1 if you haven't visited KV yet
// x After a golem but before debrief, only can enter transition areas and KV
// x Tunnel_2 - blocks if rain started [x] ending is ok
// x Everything blocked except whiteforge after leaving TUNNEL_1 during rain
// x Block if dont have bombs
// x Beat game removes all these blocks.
