FUCK YOU KURT. My name is the stag. My favorite type of beef jerky is teriyaki, though I am quite partial to the spicy tabasco variety. If you had to ask me where I buy my beef jerky, I'd almost certainly answer 7-11! But why even bother when there are turnips to save, turnips located in my garden - located off of route 58, in the middle of northern Arkansas.

//Aliph's shield can be pointed up, down, left, or\nright by using Aliph's movement controls. For\nexample, moving to the right will automatically\npoint the shield to the right as well.
別の方向にシールドを向けてみて。
//Try pointing the shield in different directions\nto see how it feels!
ヘルプ: シールド

走っている方向に関わらず、\nシールドの向きを固定したいときはシールドロック技能を使う。\nロックをしたい方向にシールドを掲げ、{CONFIRM_KEY}ボタンを押し、\nそのまま押し続けるとロックができるよ。

このゲージはエイリフの体内に\nおけるむらさき色とみどり色エネルギーの割合を示す。
//This bar represents Aliph's energy alignment\ntowards Purple or Green energy:
エイリフがエネルギーを持ったものに触ると、\n彼女の体内エネルギーのバランスが変るよ。
//When Aliph touches a charged object like\nthese, her energy alignment will be affected:
みどり色の排出口の排気
//Green-charged vent exhaust
むらさき色のポッド型植物
//Purple-charged pod plant
ヘルプ: エネルギーレベル
// Instructions: THE ENERGY SYSTEM
むらさき色の体内エネルギーが増えるほど走るのが早くなり、\nみどり色の体内エネルギーが増えるほど高くジャンプできるよ!

//(If she stops pressing into the wall,\nshe will fall to the ground!)
ヘルプ: 壁登り

//To do this, Aliph\nmust begin moving\naway from the wall\nat roughly the same\ntime that she jumps.
ヘルプ: 壁ジャンプ
//INSTRUCTIONS: WALL JUMPING
壁ジャンプは最初難しいかもしれない\nけど、どんどん慣れて、文字を大文字に\nするために押すシフトキーみたいに\n自然な動作になるよ。\nすぐに複雑な地形を簡単に\n冒険することができるようになるよ!
//Jumping off walls may seem\ncomplicated at first, but\nsoon it will become second\nnature, like holding the\nSHIFT key to type a capital\nletter! Soon you will be\nable to use wall climbing\nand wall jumping to navigate\ncomplex terrain with ease!

// This monologue happens after choosing a new game file. The character's name is Humus, but appears as a cloaked figure because the player doesn't learn so until the end of the game. However, Aliph meets Humus throughout the game (but the player doesn't know it's the same narrator who will be speaking here).
//The world is destroyed at the end of the game (spoilers, oh well) , but Aliph asks Humus to tell the story of her world to other people, hence this monologue.
//The game displays the character's name as "Storyteller" whenever "Cloaked_Humus" is used.

//　!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%The world of Even the Ocean will be familiar to you in many ways. There are continents and oceans and lakes and rivers and humans and all manner of other plants and creatures, as there are on your own Earth.
!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%ただしこの世界とこの物語は ダークマターを成す ふたつの偏極エネルギーを中心に進んでいく

//　!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%Dark, Purple energy is strongly associated with horizontal motion. Light, Green with vertical. The greater the disparity, the stronger these effects are manifest in the system. The prime example of this is Whiteforge City.

//　!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%Whiteforge City is the most concentrated hub of human activity in this world. Its extraordinary, gravity-defying architecture is a testament to mankind's ability to wield energy alignments on a massive scale. For this, it is sometimes called "the Grand City of Light Energy".

//　!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%Dotting the continent at varying distances from Whiteforge are power plants that serve to distill or isolate the energy types into extreme concentrations for human use. Our story begins at one such power plant, located in the Fay Rouge region.

%%pic%Biggs%% %%speaker%g%0%% %%im%%Listen, Doc...we need someone brave, someone willing to try things that no one else has ever done, in order to fulfill the...Greater Interests of Whiteforge. Aliph sure seems like our ticket!

%%pic%Snickwad%% %%speaker%g%1%% %%im%%Well. It's your decision, Mayor Biggs. But let it be known that the damage to the suits of agents 18C and 03A at Fay Rouge occurred only because of astronomically unlikely events in conjunction with the fact that they were wearing last year's model of Forgetech Protective Armor. THIS year's model has specifically addressed the joint issues of the last model based on our extensive safety testing procedures. 
%%aliph%% %%im%%Believe me, it's not personal! I just... I can't wear that suit.
%%pic%Snickwad%% %%speaker%g%1%% %%im%%Irrational and stubborn...perhaps you're right, Mayor. 
%%pic%Biggs%% %%speaker%g%0%%Well all right then, it's settled! Aliph, you have my approval and the full backing of Whiteforge City. Check in by radio when you reach the location of the Power Plant you want to take care of, and again when the Plant is fixed. With any luck, you'll be back here sipping martinis by the end of the week!

%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Speaking of your job, let's get back to it. Did you see any more carcasses? Have the large creature sightings been corroborated by further witnesses?

%%aliph%% %%im%%Oh yeah, right here.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%We'll analyze these and come to further conclusions. There is no need for you to speculate any further. We want to avoid spreading ignorance and misinformation to those who might lack the critical thinking skills to properly parse it.
%%aliph%% %%im%%... (Really? "...lack the critical thinking skills?")

SCENE debrief
//<all 3 technicians are here>
//<if Lopez>
%%speaker%g%2%% %%pic%Lopez%% %%im%%Aliph saved my life, Mr. Mayor. She is a true hero, and a very fine technician!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%So true, so true!
//<if Paxton>
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%Well, we're back. What's the plan? How do we deal with these new threats? 
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Excellent work, Aliph! Yet again!
// 4
%%aliph%% %%im%%I'm just glad everyone made it back safely. I'm not sure we sho	uld be going out to any more plants alone at this point!
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Our plan was logical: spreading our resources should have allowed us to maintain our power plants in a fraction of the time. The flaw was in the execution. Now the Golems have the upper-hand, and once again, we've been put on the defensive!
%%aliph%% %%im%%Golems? Upper-hand? What did I miss?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%As initial observation would suggest, we have confirmed that the large creatures in question consist of a heretofore unheard of mix of animal, vegetable, and mineral materials.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%We're calling them "Golems". There appear to be 3 distinct Golems that we know of, each made of a different mix of stuff.
%%aliph%% %%im%%I don't understand... did you determine their makeup from the carcass sample I brought back? What do the carcasses have to do with the Golems?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%The Golems have been attacking with spore-like offshoots--small creatures formed from their materials, which float off and disrupt energy patterns in our power plants. The carcasses you saw were the remains of these "spores".
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%Whoever or whatever is behind these terrorist attacks, we won't let them get away with it! They've bitten off more than they can chew, attacking Whiteforge!
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%There are several steps we are taking to prevent further damages. Firstly, we will be installing anti-Golem weaponry around the heart of Whiteforge, in case the Golems decide to attack here. We have also instructed contacts at our other plants to watch for the Golems. We were caught off guard during the first wave of attacks, and our communication was severely lacking.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Okay, that sounds good.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Wait, so what did you mean by them having the "upper-hand"?
%%speaker%g%2%% %%pic%Lopez%% %%im%%Yes, you said we are on the defensive?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Well, as I've just said, we instructed our contacts to watch for the Golems. And while you were gone, 3 more plants reported distant Golem sightings. It appears that the enemy is planning a second wave of assault.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%Yes, and we're going to need YOU to go and fight them off!
%%aliph%% %%im%%!!!
%%aliph%% %%im%%You want US to fight the Golems? B-but how? We're just technicians!
%%speaker%g%2%% %%pic%Lopez%% %%im%%And aren't these creatures huge like a building? What could we possibly do to stop them?
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%Aw, don't get your respective panties in a bunch... I'm sure there's a plan?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%There is. We currently do not have heavy weaponry installed at the outer plants. In order to attack the Golems, we need you to redirect the power plant exhaust vents to concentrate on a specific point near each Golem. The combined energy discharge should unbalance the Golem's energy alignment and drive them away from the plants. 
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Get to the central control room and we'll guide you through the process from there.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Okay. Travel to each plant, reach the central control room, and redirect the exhaust vents at the Golems. That... actually seems surprisingly doable.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%Of course it's doable! You've been able to meet every other challenge so far!
%%aliph%% %%im%%We'll all be going together, right?
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%You and Lopez should stick together. I can handle one on my own.
%%speaker%g%2%% %%pic%Lopez%% %%im%%No, Paxton, it's too dangerous!
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%It won't be dangerous at all, if I get there before the Golem does. And the best chance we have of beating the Golems to the plants is splitting up.
%%aliph%% %%im%%I agree with Lopez. None of us should be going alone.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%It's settled then: you'll all go together.
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%You've got to be kidding me.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Paxton, don't you remember what happened the last time we all went alone?

//38 <Mayor always messes up Darnell Vale's name, even though Vale has worked very hard to gain the Mayor's recognition, to the detriment of his familial relationships.> He's 
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%And last, Lengle Woods! A misty little patch of woods, with not much to do - a bit boring, if I do say so myself! 
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%yn%Riverton%40%Oscar Basin%41%Lengle Woods%42%%Anyways, all the plants put in reports at similar times, so it's up to you, which you want to tackle first. What's your decision?
//40 <player must choose one, because Paxton is going to go ahead of you>
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Ah, Riverton, charming little town that is. Good first choice. I'll bet you don't want to see such an idyllic place turned into a battleground! Well with any luck, you'll be able to shut down that Golem before it can barely begin.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Oscar Basin, yes. Chairman... er... Nardell Kale sure has put a lot of effort into keeping that settlement up to snuff. Be sure to pack a jacket though...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Lengle Woods? Odd first choice... not much around the plant besides a library! But I trust your judgment, Aliph! Any way you want to do it, is fine by me!

//Professor Chamberton: 
//<historian who you can talk to earlier about history and stuff, but this is the first mandatory dialogue. now chamberton gives you an overview of what they've found.>
%%speaker%g%1%% %%im%% %%pic%Chamberton%%For a long time, we thought that ours was the first technologically advanced civiliation that had ever existed in the world. We've traced our lineage far back to primitive nomadic roots.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%im%% %%pic%Chamberton%%Imagine our surprise when we found another place with peeps and stuff. 
%%speaker%g%1%% %%im%% %%pic%Chamberton%%We realized upon examining the remains of this civilization, that this civ died from a huge drought... and that it was way older than our earlier direct precursors. 
%%speaker%g%1%% %%im%% %%pic%Chamberton%%An entire civilizaiton was built up, then the world reset... everything started over from nothing.
//<just kind of glossing over the whole evolution involved in this process... people and animals continuing to sprout up even though there are no survivors... the cycle resetting stuff is like a werid mix of mythology and scienc,e hopefully people won't be too nitpicky about it. Is it too much? I don't really know how to handle that. I mean Humus is like a proto-person... peoplelike things (humus) are already seen to be just formed out of the earth so it's not that weird.>
%%speaker%g%1%% %%im%% %%pic%Chamberton%%Based on what we can tell from the ruins of the previous civilization, they were not the first, either. There appears to be a cycle---drought, flood, drought, flood. Every time the civilizations begin to reach a state of technological advancement the end comes. 
%%speaker%g%1%% %%im%% %%pic%Chamberton%%The end is brought on by the apearrance of 3 huge creatures. the Golems. These creatures act as harbingers... bringing about the apocalypse. The previous civilization fought the creatures, but only defeated 2 of the 3. And then they were overtaken by drought. 
%%speaker%g%1%% %%im%% %%pic%Chamberton%%Our only hope is to destroy all of the doombringers before they bring on the great flood which will destroy all of us!!
%%aliph%% %%im%%This... this is unbelievable! The Golems are here to bring the apocalypse??
%%speaker%g%0%% %%im%% %%pic%Biggs%%Aliph... now you see why it is so important to continue. Why you must not give up!! Cassidy and Paxton laid down their lives for this cause! We must avenge their deaths and save all of mankind!!
%%aliph%% %%im%%Wait, so Paxton and Cassidy knew about this?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%im%% %%pic%Biggs%%Well... no. We didn't say anything because we weren't yet certain that this was happening. But its clear to us now that the signs are here. We had of course hoped that the previous civilization was wrong... but the signs are here. All the same, we must prevail... it is the only option we have!
%%aliph%% %%im%%So... what... what do I do?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%im%% %%pic%Biggs%%Continue the work, Aliph. Drive off the golems from our plants. We'll need all the energy we can store to power the central guns in Whiteforge. With all of our plants pumping energy simultaneously, the lasers should have enough power to destroy the Golems. It's our only hope. If you drive the golems off rfom the outer plants,, ventually they will attack whiteforge,, and here we will make our final stand and destroy them!!
%%aliph%% %%im%%So... I just need to continue on...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%im%% %%pic%Biggs%%For Cassidy! For Paxton! ...For us all!

%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Why not? Do you just know everything already?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%No, I do not know everything. But I am not curious. Also, I do not trust that the process of questioning humans will lead to greater understanding.

%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I... I can get that. Sometimes I feel like if were about to... about to lose all sense of myself permanently, I would feel dissatisfied or longing to have done more. But a lot of the time... it just feels like it would be nice. 
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Do you never feel mixed about it though?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%My understanding is that the desires to "accomplish", to "succeed", to "create" are merely branches of survival instincts.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%But still, they're really human, right? I mean... it's kind of all we have right? Doesn't everyone want to know at the end that they did something with their life? That they changed things or made things better somehow?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Your precise sentiments are rather more culturally bounded than you might realize, but it is true that humans generally appreciate the feeling of accomplishing meaningful tasks in their lives.

%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I dunno, people are freaking out. After the Golems attacked the city, word got out that they were bringing an apocalyptic flood. When this rain started up... everyone figured you'd failed to destroy them. What happened??
%%im%% %%aliph%%I destroyed them! All of them! I did exactly what I was supposed to do!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%What?? So... so what's happening?
%%im%% %%aliph%%I don't know! I don't know fucking anything about anything! I just... I just did what I was supposed to do! I've got to talk to Mayor Biggs and Doctor Snickwad!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Wait, Aliph... I don't think they really know what's going on. Aren't they the ones that sent you on that mission? Let's talk to Humus.
%%im%% %%aliph%%I've tried to talk to Humus already! Everything they say is just evasive and confusing!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%No, I've talked to Humus more... there's just a certain way you've got to ask them stuff. Please, I think they might be able to help us...

%%im%% %%aliph%%Okay. We can talk to Humus for a bit. But we'll probably run into the Mayor anyway on the way to the jail!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%%Come on, let's go!
// Humus  walks in 13
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Humus!
%%im%% %%aliph%%Huh? I thought you were still in jail!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%How did you get here?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Eh? I walked.
%%im%% %%aliph%%Okay, never mind how. Humus, we need to know what's happening. I killed the Golems, and the Golems were bringing about the flood to destroy us, right? So will there be no flood now that the Golems are destroyed?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%The flood has always been inevitable. The question has always been when, not if, it will occur.
%%im%% %%aliph%%... Okay fine, it's inevitable. Has it been delayed though? Are we safe for now until more Golems come or something?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%More Golems will not appear before the great flood of this world.
%%im%% %%aliph%%Well, if it's not the Golems, then who is trying to destroy the world?! Please just tell me if you know!!
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Trying to destroy the world?...
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%No entity is trying to destroy the world.
%%im%% %%aliph%%So what are you saying?? The world is just ending for no reason?? It's just a fun old random apocalypse and there's nothing we could ever have done about it??!!
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Anything and everything can alter the time and quality of the flood. 
%%im%% %%aliph%%Ugh... see what good is this, Yara? Humus is just leading us around in circles. What's the point??
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%No, we're making progress, Aliph! Let me try. Humus gives confusing answers to questions about personal agency. Hmmm...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Humus, you said that the everything affects the flood. But some things have disproportionate effects on the flood, right?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Yes, of course. Entities with greater power wield greater influence on the mechanisms of the world around them.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Greater power... Whiteforge!! I mean... the humans of Whiteforge and our civilization have the greatest consolidated power and influence in the world, right?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Correct.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%So how does our power affect the flood? What does Whiteforge do with its power that would bring or delay the flood?
%%im%% %%aliph%%Well, Whiteforge is "the Grand City of Light Energy". The focus seems to be on channelling light energy to the city which then fuels the vertically-oriented architecture and technology.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Okay, so Whiteforge alters the energy alignment of many places to create extremes. OH.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Aliph... when a person's energy level reaches an extreme...
%%im%% %%aliph%%They die.
%%im%% %%aliph%%So the world is... dying? Because we unbalanced it?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Humus, can extreme energy disparities like those created by Whiteforge's power plants increase the chances of the flood?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Yes, that is correct.
%%im%% %%aliph%%...
%%im%% %%aliph%%Holy shit... no, no, no... that can't be it. No, fuck, that can't be it!!
%%im%% %%aliph%%The Golems were trying to destroy the plants... they were trying to rebalance the world! And I... I killed them... I killed them all.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%A-Aliph...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%We don't know why they attacked. It could have been a coincidence.

%%aliph%% %%im%%...
//<Yara and Aliph are h	uddled together, Humus is nearby. They are outside, watching the water come> 
%%aliph%% %%im%%We should have seen it coming.
%%aliph%% %%im%%I should have seen it coming.
%%aliph%% %%im%%I guess power just corrupts people. Is that it, Humus? We got greedy and exploitative, and this is our punishment.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Hmmm... No, that's not it. Power does not corrupt... power IS corrupt.
%%aliph%% %%im%%What is that supposed to mean?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Power is the capacity to direct the course of events or the behavior of others. One cannot be powerful without exerting control over weaker forces.
%%aliph%% %%im%%What? So you're saying that the ability to... just DO stuff is evil?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%I did not speak of moral good or evil.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%...
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%When a plant or animal is transferred to an environment where it has an abundance of resources, physical advantages, and/or a lack of predators, that species enters a position of power. It will garner an ever larger share of the environment's resources to the detriment of the environment's earlier inhabitants. Humans call this an "invasive species".
%%aliph%% %%im%%Okay...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I think I get it... Is there ever a point at which an invasive species becomes Evil? Does it even make sense to think about this situation in terms of Good and Evil?
%%aliph%% %%im%%Well, no... those are plants and animals. Humans deal in morality. Or create it... or something. I don't know.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Humans are animals. We do what we need to do to survive, just like everything else.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%But... we've got so much power, the people of Whiteforge... at least the richer ones, that we don't need to fight for survival. Not really, not on a day-to-day basis. We've normalized the concept of just being comfortable and fine and "dying of old age", as if that isn't a position of great power, as if that isn't completely different than most creatures that have ever lived. And deep down... it's like we can never understand it. We just need to keep exerting our power and exerting our power as if it's the only thing keeping us alive. Even though... for a long time... that hasn't been the case at all.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%We build a giant tower to fuck the sky because we can never fully understand how powerful we are... and we can never find balance until it's forced on us. Until we become weak. Until the ocean washes us away.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I think that's what Humus means, when they say that power is corrupt. Individual acts of violence are an inherent part of the struggle for survival in any ecosystem. But when the power becomes unbalanced, the violence becomes unbalanced. 
%%aliph%% %%im%%So...the flood is coming to put us in our place. 
%%aliph%% %%im%%...Oh no, Humus is going to take issue with that statement...
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%The earth does not care if you unbalance its energy. The mountains do not cry if you cause them to crumble. And the water does not wait to hear your penitence before it swallows you whole. Systems have physical properties, these properties play out, your world continues to function, a tiny droplet in sea of the universe.
%%aliph%% %%im%%So you're saying there's no point? And there's nothing or nobody that is good or bad?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%That, I cannot answer.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Well, I'd like to find out... but there just isn't a lot of time left, is there?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%If it's any consolation, Aliph, many people have lived to ripe old ages without any more satisfying answers.
%%aliph%% %%im%%It all just feels so hopeless. Not just us... not just our lives. But Whiteforge. Everything. I mean maybe if we could write stuff down in a way that would somehow survive the flood... But how? And what? There's not enough time to figure anything out! I've had too many whiplashes back and forth over the past few weeks. Everything is blending together. I have no ground to stand on.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I have one idea.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Humus.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Yes?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%%I have this feeling that you aren't as bound to this time and place as us. That you could survive the flood, or travel to places that we could never reach. Is that true?

%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Hmmm...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Maybe if you told it to other people... people who had more time... they could make something more of all this than we could? Maybe everything we went through could all be more worthwhile, somehow?

This is the entrance to the Canyon Gauntlet, one of the first Gauntlet areas from Even The Ocean.
This is the entrance to the Test Gauntlet! There are two main types of areas in Even The Ocean, Nature and Gauntlet areas. Gauntlet areas in Even the Ocean are linear in nature, scattered with checkpoints. They focus on moments of rising and falling tension, vs. the Nature areas which are more open and exploratory in nature.
If you press the Interact key, you can lock the direction of your four-direction-shield, which can be used for blocking certain objects, and a bit more.
You can save your game at this fire.

This is a demo of the game 'Even The Ocean'. It features a few test areas and then one level from the final game (that still needs to be revised.) None of the art in this demo is final. It's actually an outdated demo, we didn't have time to polish the final intro stuff of the game yet. But still, I hope you enjoy it.
Nope! In the full version of "Even The Ocean", we take advantage of the longform structure that we chose to use in creating the game, in order to explore the mechanics more deeply as well as look at themes related to the idea of balance in everyday human life. We do this through light narrative exposition as well as visual and audio ambience, and the use of the single core mechanic that you will soon be experiencing!
Look for a Q2 2015 release for Win/Mac/Linux, and eventually Nintendo and Sony systems. In the meantime, you should follow the game's Twitter at @eventheocean to stay up to date!\nAs for who made this, it is made by Jon Kittaka (@even_kei, art, writing, design) and Melos Han-Tani (@han_tani, music, code, design, biz).

Still, I sometimes get freaked out, you know--what if someone sees? And on top of that, worrying about the Red Emerald Marble. I know it's not such a big deal, but on the grass... everything seems bigger, you know?

I don't know exactly what that means, but that's part of why it's so freaky, right? I'm thinking I might just try to go find it myself you know, just so no one else will have it.
%%after%5%%Normally it's great, it's amazing. All the rules are flipped, it's like a whole different world in a dream you know. You can feel stuff and it's all so strong, it's like life but like *more* than life, you know? And then you wake up and you lie there and your body feels all soft and you try and recreate what just happened in your head so that it doesn't all just dissolve away but it always does.

Trent. Bay. You both have been using me lately to vent about each other and I won't be put in the middle any longer. Bay, I refuse to let you just go without talking things through!
T: Bay! You... you were going to leave us?
B: I didn't think you'd miss me. I mean maybe you'd miss the cooking, or the chores that I--
T: Bay! That's not fair! Of course I would miss you!
B: You say that. You say romantic things, but your actions... everything you really DO is meant to drive me off.
T: What have I done to drive you off??
B: You put SALT in the FERTILIZER, Trent. You LITERALLY SALTED OUR FIELDS.
T: I... but... "the salt of the earth..."
B: No, Trent, salting fields is what people did in war. To their ENEMIES. That's why our plants are dying!
T: Our plants are dying? Uh... I mean... whoops!
B: Goddamn you Trent!
T: I'm sorry Bay! I really am! It was an accident, I didn't know!
B: Well you know what you DO know? You KNOW that our crops are important to me! You KNOW that I don't like your paint brushes in the toothbrush holder. You KNOW that Thursday nights are star nights. 
Accidents are accidents, sure, but at a certain point, you clearly just don't care anymore.
T: ... I... I had no idea that all this stuff was adding up in your mind. I knew I was forgetting stuff here and there but you've been so cold lately. I thought you didn't want to be around me... that you were tired of my displays of affection. That's why I've been so absorbed in my work.
B: So. I became more of a hermit, and you got your head increasingly stuck in a cloud. We set out to become more like each other... but maybe being with each other allowed us to become more and more like ourselves. 
V: Phew! This is going somewhere. I was terrified it wouldn't.

I'll be leaving soon to go beyond the outer mountains, the last area of land the City hasn't bothered developing yet, so maybe I can find some peace of mind to do my work for a while. A note to myself about the City, so I know for later: there's nothing wrong with you, I wouldn't have helped architect so much of you if I didn't like you.

It's my first day as a mechanic, and, ah... I'm nervous. They paired me with Cassidy, a Senior Engineer! Cassidy's all business, but caring, I think? Hoping today goes smoothly, it's just gonna be a routine repair... textbook stuff.
A freak lightning storm took out the bridge, we fell into a cave, and... Cassidy, well, they're... not with me anymore. The shock destroyed my armor as well, and I can't communicate with the city. I really need to get out of here...
Thankfully, I managed to piece together a makeshift shield from my armor. I'm gonna try to finish the repairs on the power plant, and then call Whiteforge for help. That's... probably the best I can do.
Somehow, I made my way through the Fay Rouge Power Plant and got the systems back online. The city said they'd send someone to get Cassidy, and that I should meet back in Whiteforge for debriefing.

A mossy, greyish colored orb, with flecks of rouge, tinged with a sense of clouds and humidity.
An orb glowing with the image of a seaside city's skyline on a sunny day.
An orb reflecting a sunny beach.
An orb reflecting a dreamy canyon at night.
An orb containing an image of a mid-day, hazy and windy hill area.
An orb with a picture of an autumn time riverwalk at morning.
An orb with the image of a misty, night-time patch of woods.
An orb reflecting a sunset over a snowy valley with a deep forest of gigantic trees.
A jewel that captures the image of the White Desert. Found in the head of the great beast only known as 'Earth'.
A jewel that reflects the image of the towering Blue Rock. Found in the head of the great bird only known as 'Air'.
A jewel that has an image of the vast Shallow Land. Found in the head of the great fish only known as 'Sea'.
A smooth stone found far down the Infinite Cliffs, that seems to absorb all moisture, yet remaining rough and dry to the touch. It almost seems dangerous to keep near the body. What would happen if one threw this into the ocean, and waited a millenia?
A smooth stone found high up the Infinite Falls, seeming to produce water, that never loses its damp feeling or wet sheen. With it, one might never go thirsty. What would happen if one threw this into a desert and waited an eternity?
A fancy-looking note-reader from two eccentric people who seemed quite tired. They said it would read special notes hidden around the world... but where?
