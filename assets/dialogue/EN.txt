# 1. COMMENTS ARE INDICATED BY "#" or "//" - DO NOT TRANSLATE
# 2. All translateable dialogue is in column B. Column A is comments or metadata. Translations should go in column C.
# 3. if a dialogue line says "ignore" or "n/a" do not translate it

# Dialogue tags can have useful context:
#	a %%pic%NAME%% tag means that the picture of this character will show. The corresponding name can usually be found under MAP portrait_names SCENE names. Sometimes they differ (like Cloaked_Humus becomes Storyteller)
#	%%name%NAME%% tags will display the person's name as "NAME" and are usually used for NPC dialogue that doesn't have a portrait. The spreadsheet gives you the names to translate.
#		For the most part the name will always be NAME, but sometimes it's different, e.g., "Cloaked_Humus" becomes Storyteller in-game. 
#	a %%yn%CHOICE_1%NEXT_POS_1%CHOICE_2%NEXT_POST_2%% Will play the text after it, but then show a box between the choices (usually 2, sometimes 3 or 4). When the person selects that choice, if "NEXT_POS_1" is -1, then the dialogue ends. If it's a number, that line number will play next. There are a few edge cases here, but it is not common.
# a %%speaker%SPEAKER_NAME%% denotes where the dialogue box's arrow will point to on screen. This only matters if SPEAKER_NAME is 'none', which means the text will be centered in the screen, with no arrow. This is almost always nondiegetic text, or a character's internal thoughts.

#		{WAIT,0.5} denotes that the dialogue will pause for 0.5 seconds at that point, so feel free to move these around or change times to fit the flow of the target language.

# Special characters - DO NOT TRANSLATE

# 		!i - should always be at the start of the line if present (in game it means as soon as this line of dialogue plays the next one will play)
#		\n - Dialogue will display a line-break
#		{CONFIRM_KEY}, {PAUSE_KEY}, etc - in-game will be replaced by the corresponding key. E.g. "C", "ENTER", or button icons if a console
#		{G1_1}, {G1_2}, etc will be replaced with location names in SCENE ui MAP main_areas - e.g. "Fay Rouge".
#		{G1_2_T} and {G1_3_T} are replaced by "Paxton" or "Lopez" (in SCENE portrait_names MAP names)
#		{G3_GOLEM_1}, etc are replaced by names in MAP s3 SCENE golem_names
#		{N0} is replaced by "Player" - this is hard-coded into the game so will need to be sent to me

When Aliph touches a charged object like\nthese, her energy alignment will be affected:
Light-charged vent exhaust
Dark-charged pod plant
INSTRUCTIONS: THE ENERGY SYSTEM
The stronger Aliph's Dark energy alignment, the\nfaster she moves horizontally. The stronger her\nLight alignment, the higher she can jump!
Strong Dark Alignment
Strong Light Alignment
It's safe and often unavoidable for Aliph's\nenergy alignment to shift around as she works...\nBut if the bar fills completely with either\nenergy, it's curtains for Aliph!
You will have to start over from the\nmost recently activated checkpoint:

!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%However, integral to this world and this story are the two polarized energy types that infuse all matter.
!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%Some call them "Dark and Light". Others refer to them by their hues of "Purple and Green". An occasional few use the mathematically-derived "X and Y". 
!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%At varying scales, all systems are affected by their energy alignment - the proportion of one energy type to the other contained within the system.
%%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%Dark Energy is strongly associated with horizontal motion. Light, with vertical. The greater the disparity, the stronger these effects are manifest in the system. The prime example of this is Whiteforge City.

%%pic%Cloaked_Humus%%%%speaker%none%%Whiteforge City is the most concentrated hub of human activity in this world.

Well listen close, because I'll let you in on a little secret. Over in the JUNKYARD, me and my buds have been working on a little passion project, one might say. A set of Obstacle Courses, to be precise, built from a lot of scrapped and leftover pieces of Power Plants. You might find that practicing with us can ease you into the finer points of Power Plant fixing in the days ahead.
// !i %%pic%Roots%%Or if you're an old pro, you can try your hand at some of our Xtreme Time Trial Courses, and see how you stack up against our best times!
!i %%pic%Roots%%You got that? If you're nervous about the tasks ahead, take the Ground Line to the Junkyard and we'll take care of you, okay? Okay.

!i %%set_state%1%1%% %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%Hi everyone! The tour is... starting now.
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%So, this special exhibition centers around the avant-garde photography circle, REJECT,  that worked together during the beginning of the construction of the Apex District...
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%...the group met through attending various social protests and gatherings near the construction site...
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%...due to their common interest in critically looking at the state of photography, eventually, the group had around five to six members, and produced work throughout its three year lifespan, spearheaded by the two photographers, Hiranaka and Yamamori...
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%...in their first magazine's memo, they proposed to 'REJECT the state of photography as being purely used for journalistic functions by the media, REJECT the notion of photography existing as only personal record-keeping,' and...
!i %%pic%Cloaked_Humus%% %%speaker%none%%Some time later...
!i %%aliph%% %%speaker%none%%Wow, that was... fascinating. Did you do all that... er, this exhibition, by yourself?
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%Oh, no, of course not! Some of my research interests overlap, but it was a big collaboration with other art historians and researchers.
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%And you know, our research ancestry. I mean, past researchers!
!i %%aliph%% %%speaker%none%%I'd always heard about those protests from my parents... but I never knew too much more about them.
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%Isn't that a shame? It's hard to find information on them... and they have such important things to say! That's the thing... all this information fades away, and we can't even start to measure what was missing... it's kind of scary...
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%Anyways, REJECT is an important circle from that time... their photos and essays seem to be conveying an anxiety about the whole situation, an instability in the time...
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%You know... on the surface they opposed the Apex project. Even with their work and the protestors, well, now we're here. But maybe that sort of undercurrent is still present today. I can wonder...
!i %%aliph%% %%speaker%none%%Yeah... hm. I wonder what they would think of the Power Plants, today.
!i %%speaker%none%% %%pic%Violet%%That's a good question. Maybe you could dig around on that topic! See what you find.

Restview Beach \n\n This Power Plant is located near the Restview Beach Resort. Originally, the area was known for being a popular fishing village. After enough time, researchers noticed that the area had the ideal conditions for a new Power Plant. \n\n A few years after construction, thanks to the new source of Light Energy, the Restview Beach Association formed, and quickly set aside funds for the construction of the Restview Beach Resort, a resort which at one point, brought in the most visitors yearly out of any other beach resort. Over the years, though, the resort waned in popularity and its various facilities have fallen into disrepair. \n\n Still, guided tours of the outskirts of the Hydro Power Plant are offered to resortgoers on a biweekly basis (reservations should be made at least a month in advance.) \n\n Though it's looking forward to better days, Restview Beach is still one place businesses and families alike can look to travel to without breaking the bank.
Dreamdram Canyon \n\n Tucked away along the side of a canyon wall , Dreamdram Canyon's Power Plant is located in an environment with one of the most mineral and crystal-rich soils in the entire world. \n\n While tours of this Power Plant have historically been strictly prohibited, a number of legal viewing spots are available. \n\n As you climb down Dreamdram Canyon's staggered walls and slopes, you'll be able to see the river passing through the canyon, as well as the distant Power Plant, whose facade sticks out from and climbs the canyon wall. At the bottom of the canyon, you'll find relief, as it's an easy and flat walk to the viewing areas. \n\n Along the way, you may notice that the high energy concentration of the soil produces a variety of flora that make Dreamdram Canyon one of the most otherworldly environments in the world! \n\n While you may visit the canyon at any time, we recommend visiting it during a cloudy night, as the crystal glow from the far canyon walls combine with the Power Plant's lights and the night horizon to create a uniquely 'Dreamdram' view. 
Boreas Heights \n\n Boreas Heights's Power Plant, located in the mountains beyond the marshland of Boreas Heights, displays an impressive feat of mountain-based engineering. The main Plant is inaccessible to the public, and much of it is located within the mountain, but its exterior features and mountain-based wind farm are worth seeing. Due to the location, to date, the Boreas Power Construction Project has been one of the most difficult Plants the city has completed. \n\n Being one of the most inaccessible Power Plants, reaching it is quite the achievement. As even the maintenance workers themselves are required to navigate hilly, rocky, and at times mountainous terrain, few people have made the journey. \n\n However, those who are ready will not be disappointed. After going through a mountain pass, the landscape turns into sprawling marshland, where your gaze will soon turn to the bridge at your feet, which crosses the murky swamp sprawling only inches below. \n\n The winds in this area are notoriously strong: we recommend plenty of safety equipment if you're going to make the trip through the rocky hills. \n\n Only a few self-sufficient and private communities are strewn throughout the hills, so it may be hard to find housing for the night. We recommend that you bring your own camping supplies, as well as purchasing some kind of emergency radio system in advance of your travels.
Riverton \n\n Riverton sits along the south bank of the Nishigawa River, in an area sprawling with oceans of crops, spotted with islands of autumnal-colored trees. It's also home to one of Whiteforge's main Power Plants, standing both on the riverbank and within the river. Tours are forbidden, but you can see much of its architecture sticking out from the middle of the river. \n\n The terrain is flat, rolling and rustic - we recommend walking along the Riverton riverwalk around sunrise, crossing cobblestone bridges, small bubbling streams, and history-worn dirt paths. If you'd like, you can even take a swim in the river itself. \n\n The area is mainly dedicated to corn, soybean and rice farming, but is also partly used for raising livestock, and a variety of other crops. The workers keep to strict schedules, living in accordance to their crops' cycles of growths. \n\n Most of the farms are family-run, and a number of small, skilled craftspeople have started their own shops. Over the years, Riverton became somewhat of a tourist town, thriving off the sales of fresh food and crafts. \n\n For tourists, Riverton offers a number of fun activities for children and adults alike, from corn mazes and pottery painting barns, to day classes for adults on local crafts and skills such as gardening and knitting. \n\n Less than a day by transit from Whiteforge City, Riverton makes for a great trip for the family.
Magdal Woods \n\n Magdal Woods sits deep in a deciduous forest south of Riverton. Originally home to one of the oldest and best-preserved libraries, it later became the site of a Power Plant. \n\n The Power Plant reaches deep underground, and its construction revealed the curious presence of a subterranean cave network. Before construction, there were protests due to worries over the Power Plant's construction damaging the environment and foundation around the library, but luckily, at the time of writing, both seem to stand in harmony with each other and the surrounding environment, and no further construction is planned. \n\n Navigating the woods can be extremely confusing if you decide to go off the beaten path. The ground beneath the trees is bumpy, and following paths becomes difficult because of small hills breaking lines of sight. \n\n Additionally, the area is prone to heavy fog in the early and late hours. \n\n Once at the library, you can look at and make photocopies of a number of rare books, and even check out a few. The library specializes in older fiction, some of which was influenced by the woods themselves. \n\n If you get a chance, be sure to donate or purchase something from the library's gift shop. If you get hungry, there is a small village a few minutes' walk from the library, which can also provide an overnight stay for those looking to explore the area further.
Oscar Basin \n\n Oscar Basin is one of the most peculiar geological formations our world has to offer. \n\n Nicknamed 'the bowl of trees', the area around Oscar Basin is close to a mix of sinkhole, valley and canyon, its walls dotted with massive, protruding tree branches. Often, the area around the village is just called 'the bowl'. \n\n The village itself is built both on top of these trees and within the snowy bowl's walls. Navigating here involves traversing a flat, snowy field. Soon, the horizon gives way to what seems to be a cliff - but no! - it's a sight you're unlikely to forget anytime soon, as the bowl unfolds before you. \n\n As you descend through ladders, branches and small paths, you can see the exhaust from a Power Plant rising from the center of the bowl. If you'd like, you can descend even further from Oscar Basin, to the bottom of the bowl, to get one of the most sublime views - seeing through a canopy of branches, up to the clear sky. \n\n As one walks amongst Oscar Basin, they may find themselves wondering about the arduous construction of such a town, amongst a growing, odd, and ancient 'forest'. \n\n Despite such a history, Oscar Basin has still found itself struggling financially, experiencing a trend of depopulation. As a result, it has turned to methods of tourism to increase revenue, leading to somewhat of a cheery, wintry atmosphere amongst the village.

Before the technological innovations that made Whiteforge possible, the only sustainable concentrations of people consisted of small villages and trading outposts. Many lived in nomadic tribes, travelling at the mercy of weather conditions to hunt and gather or to graze livestock.
Archeological study has shown that these nomadic societies often had religious beliefs that prized Dark Energy over Light.  Many natural concentrations of Dark Energy throughout the land are marked by ancient cairns. These stone markers were often stained with purple dyes in the characteristic hue of Dark Energy.
This ancient crystal pendant is thought to have once been charged with Dark Energy and worn around the neck. Over the course of the day, the pendant would slowly release its charge into the skin of its wearer. The existence of such jewelry demonstrates the almost obsessive relationship these tribes had with Dark Energy. Fervent religious devotion or perhaps superstition must have led them to wear such pendants despite the potential health-risks.
It was only by recognizing the gravity-defying power of Light Energy that mankind was able to rapidly innovate and develop. Vertical architecture blossomed with the development of Light Energy-infused tools and machinery, meeting an ever growing demand for housing in what would shortly become known as Whiteforge City.
In the dense, rich exchange of Whiteforge City, culture and innovation flourished, spurring the citizens to greater and greater heights, both figuratively and literally. This golden age has continued to this day, and nowhere is this more evident than in the relatively recent creation of the Apex District, which hovers above the city, weightless and serene. The centerpiece of Apex and the symbol of modern Whiteforge, is the Sunray Spire. The Sunray Spire transmits numerous wireless signals both locally and throughout the world to facilitate the spread of resources and information, making possible our way of life!

%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Speaking of your job, let's get back to it. Did you see any more carcasses? Have the large creature sightings been confirmed by further witnesses?
%%aliph%% %%im%%Oh, um, yes on both counts. Looks like there really is some kind of invasion going on... but who could possibly be behind it?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Where is the tissue sample?
%%aliph%% %%im%% %%item%45%0%%Oh yeah, right here.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%We'll analyze these and come to further conclusions. There is no need for you to speculate any further. We want to avoid spreading ignorance and misinformation to those who might lack the critical thinking skills to properly parse it.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Well, I've already been instructed to avoid alarming the public. But if I'm going to be working in these Plants, I should know what's going on!
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%No need to be confrontational, Aliph. I'm merely looking out for the best interests of Whiteforge.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%Hahaha, that's what we're all doing here! Go team! Hahaha!

%%aliph%%Yes please.
//<transition. Yara cooking> 4
%%pic%Yara%%I'm trying to keep a hold on things. Cassidy had a good chunk of retirement savings built up from her previous job, and that's keeping me afloat, but I can't live off it forever...
//<yara sits at couch> 5
%%yn%Right.%6%You need a plan for the future.%6%% %%pic%Yara%%I just don't know what I'm going to do. I feel like I'm not good at anything. Nothing that makes money, anyway. I've never been comfortable at any job I've had. I kind of latched onto Cassidy - for a lot of reasons, she was amazing - but, also... she was so capable! But... right now I just need to make it through each day, right?
!i %%pic%Yara%%I've been thinking...
!i %%pic%Yara%%Cassidy kept up a garden in the nearby lot, and I want to keep it going. It was really important to her. I... I was never any good at gardening, but I feel like I just need to try this, you know?
!i %%aliph%%I think that's a really good idea!
!i %%pic%Yara%%Doesn't really help with money that much. Well, I'll get some food out of the deal, but I'm not sure how the cost of supplies and labor and everything shakes out. It's something to get me out of bed, anyway.
!i %%aliph%%Yeah. Hey, is something burning?
%%pic%Yara%%Huh? Oh no, not again!

!i %%aliph%%Hey... hey there. It's okay, Yara.
!i %%pic%Yara%%I knew I would mess it up! I knew it!
!i %%aliph%%It's okay... we have leftover muffins to eat!
!i %%pic%Yara%%I wanted to cook the garden vegetables... I wanted to show that I could do something for myself. But it's all ruined...
%%aliph%%Hey, come here... come here...
//<hugs. Aliph starts humming Even the Ocean> 18
!i %%pic%Yara%%Are you humming Even the Ocean?
!i %%aliph%%Yeah, you know it? My mom used to sing it to me, as a lullaby.
!i %%pic%Yara%%Can you sing it to me?
%%aliph%%Yeah...
//<Aliph sings (still just instrumentation of some sort, but different sound than the hum and lyrics overlaid on the screen, like i think how it works in the famous FF6 opera scene, so you can kind of read how the lyrics go with the music, and imagine it being sung). the song is a lullaby about love reaching across all barriers--"even the ocean". they are on the floor of the kitchen. blackout transition to being back on the couch> 
// Overlay 22
!i %%pic%Yara%%That song still comforts me, even though I don't believe it.
!i %%aliph%%What do you mean?
!i %%pic%Yara%%Well. My parents sang it to me too. But they don't talk to me anymore.
!i %%aliph%%Oh Yara, I'm sorry.
!i %%pic%Yara%%But it's not just that. It's just... love...
!i %%pic%Yara%%The idea of love as this universal thing that crosses all barriers... it just... intimidates me. Because I don't think I get that. I mean love is really important to me, but I don't think I've ever loved someone in a way that wasn't partly just a reflection of my own needs and desires. I've never felt like I was reaching out to touch some perfect, divine quality that could conquer anything. It's always felt very human, and... well limited to me, even when the feelings are strong.
!i %%pic%Yara%%But even just talking about this feels bad... like I'm destroying something just by having these thoughts. Maybe I'm just revealing something pitiful about myself, personally.
!i %%aliph%%No... I think I maybe get what you're saying.
!i %%pic%Yara%%And the song still hits me, right? I still have these yearnings. Sometimes it seems like we just have to say things we don't believe like an incantation... like if we say it enough, it could actualize the reality we want to live in.
!i %%aliph%%Maybe... but what you're doing is also valuable. Because if people only speak from their ideals, then sooner or later someone... or maybe a lot of people... will feel like they're broken for not measuring up.
%%pic%Yara%%Yeah... what are you gonna do...
//<fade out> 33
!i %%aliph%%I hope things work out for Yara with the garden, and with everything else...
!i %%aliph%%Hmm, well, spending time with Yara drove the day's revelations out of my mind for a while. But wow, what is going on with the world? What are these creatures, and why are they attacking? It hardly seems possible... I almost don't even want to find out, but somehow I've been thrust into the middle of all this.
%%aliph%%Anyway, I hope {G1_3_T} is alright. I guess I should just get some sleep already.

//<all 3 technicians are here>
//<if Lopez>
%%speaker%none%% %%pic%Lopez%% %%im%%Aliph saved my life, Mr. Mayor. She is a true hero, and a very fine technician!
%%speaker%none%% %%pic%Biggs%%So true, so true!	
//<if Paxton>
%%speaker%none%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%Well, we're back. What's the plan? How do we deal with these new threats? 
%%speaker%none%% %%pic%Biggs%%Excellent work, Aliph! Yet again!
// 4
%%aliph%% %%im%%I'm just glad everyone made it back safely. I'm not sure we should be going out to any more Plants alone at this point!
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Our plan was logical: spreading our resources should have allowed us to maintain our Power Plants in a fraction of the time. The flaw was in the execution. Now the Geomes have the upper-hand, and once again, we've been put on the defensive!
%%aliph%% %%im%%Geomes? Upper-hand? What did I miss?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%As initial observation would suggest, we have confirmed that the large creatures in question consist of a heretofore unheard of mix of animal, vegetable, and mineral materials.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%We're calling them "Geomes". There appear to be 3 distinct Geomes that we know of, each made of a different mix of stuff - the walking Earth Geome, flying Air Geome, and swimming Sea Geome.
%%aliph%% %%im%%I don't understand... did you determine their makeup from the carcass sample I brought back? What do the carcasses have to do with the Geomes?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%The Geomes have been attacking with spore-like offshoots--small creatures formed from their materials, which float off and disrupt energy patterns in our Power Plants. The carcasses you saw were the remains of these "spores".
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%There are several steps we are taking to prevent further damages. Firstly, we will be installing anti-Geome weaponry around the heart of Whiteforge, in case the Geomes decide to attack here. We have also instructed contacts at our other Plants to watch for the Geomes. We were caught off guard during the first wave of attacks, and our communication was severely lacking.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%Whoever or whatever is behind these terrorist attacks, we won't let them get away with it! They've bitten off more than they can chew, attacking Whiteforge!
%%aliph%% %%im%%Okay, that sounds good.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Wait, so what did you mean by them having the "upper-hand"?
%%speaker%g%2%% %%pic%Lopez%% %%im%%Yes, you said we are on the defensive?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Well, as I've just said, we instructed our contacts to watch for the Geomes. And while you were gone, 3 more Plants reported distant Geome sightings. It appears that the enemy is planning a second wave of assault.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%Yes, and we're going to need YOU to go and fight them off!
%%aliph%% %%im%%W-what??
%%aliph%% %%im%%You want US to fight the Geomes? B-but how? We're just technicians!
%%speaker%g%2%% %%pic%Lopez%% %%im%%And aren't these creatures huge like a building? What could we possibly do to stop them?
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%Aw, don't get your respective panties in a bunch... I'm sure there's a plan?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%There is. We currently do not have heavy weaponry installed at the outer Plants. In order to attack the Geomes, we need you to redirect the Power Plant exhaust vents to concentrate on a specific point near each Geome. The combined energy discharge should unbalance the Geome's energy alignment and drive them away from the Plants. 
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Snickwad%% %%im%%Get to the central control room and we'll guide you through the process from there. While these Power Plants are mostly functional, there are some repairs you'll need to do before redirecting the vents.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Okay. Travel to each Plant, reach the central control room, and redirect the exhaust vents at the Geomes. That... actually seems surprisingly doable.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%Of course it's doable! You've been able to meet every other challenge so far!
%%aliph%% %%im%%We'll all be going together, right?
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%You and Lopez should stick together. I can handle one on my own.
%%speaker%g%2%% %%pic%Lopez%% %%im%%No, Paxton, it's too dangerous!
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%It won't be dangerous at all, if I get there before the Geome does. And the best chance we have of beating the Geomes to the Plants is splitting up.
%%aliph%% %%im%%I agree with Lopez. None of us should be going alone.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%im%%It's settled then: you'll all go together.
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%You've got to be kidding me.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Paxton, don't you remember what happened the last time we all went alone? If one of us were to get trapped while a Geome was attacking...
%%speaker%g%3%% %%pic%Paxton%% %%im%%Fine, fine, let's get on with it already. So where are we headed, O Magnanimous Leader?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Hastings! The Map!
//36 <Hastings pushes over the map. goes to map screen with Mayor talking over it, giving description of each area>
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%This is Riverton! A rustic, small village, along the banks of a river. Great fun to visit with the family!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%And this is Oscar Basin, a town within a snowy, forested valley, run by Chairman... er what was his name? Darbell Nail? Hmm...
//38 <Mayor always messes up Darnell Vale's name, even though Vale has worked very hard to gain the Mayor's recognition, to the detriment of his familial relationships.> He's 
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%And last, Magdal Woods! A misty little patch of woods, with not much to do - a bit boring, but still with a Power Plant in danger, nonetheless.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%% %%yn%Riverton%40%Oscar Basin%41%Magdal Woods%42%%Anyways, all the Plants put in reports at similar times, so it's up to you, which you want to tackle first. What's your decision?
//40 <player must choose one, because Paxton is going to go ahead of you>
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Ah, Riverton, charming little town that is. Good first choice. I'll bet you don't want to see such an idyllic place turned into a battleground! Well with any luck, you'll be able to shut down that Geome before it can barely begin.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Oscar Basin, yes. Chairman... er... Nardell Kale sure has put a lot of effort into keeping that settlement up to snuff. Be sure to pack a jacket though...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Magdal Woods? Odd first choice... not much around the Plant besides a library! But I trust your judgment, Aliph! Any way you want to do it, is fine by me!

%%aliph%% %%im%%Wh-what? Do you know what they are? Why they are attacking?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Biggs%%Let's go meet Dr. Wodsnick in the History Wing. There is a lot to go over.
ENDSCENE

SCENE debrief_history
%%pic%Snickwad%%My predecessors believed that ours was the first technologically advanced civilization that had ever existed in the world. Through archeological study, we had traced our lineage all the way back to primitive nomadic roots. The record seemed clear.
// wodsnick_1
%%pic%Snickwad%%As a young researcher, I took part in an expedition to explore the outer continents to the East. We were driven by a thirst for knowledge, a desire to see things that no one had ever seen before. And, of course, to chart a path for future resource collection and colonization in the event that Whiteforge civilization continued to expand at the incredible rate that we were beginning to witness.
// wodsnick_2 2
%%pic%Snickwad%%Imagine our surprise when we found the remains of an entire city, almost appearing to rival Whiteforge in its sheer size and technological advancement. After much study, we were able to roughly translate the language used by this ancient civilization from contextual clues. We call this civilization Karavold, though of course there is no way to know for sure how it was pronounced at the time.
// wodsnick_3 3
!i %%pic%Snickwad%%On close examination, we found that this entire civilization was dramatically cut short by an extraordinary drought. A drought that struck the entire world including our Western continent, according to Karavoldish records. The Karavoldish people had done some exploration and development here, but when the drought came, they found it equally as dry as their own home.
!i %%pic%Snickwad%%The implications of this worldwide drought were staggering, and confirmed by further research...
%%pic%Snickwad%%Karavold was not merely "ancient" like our ancestors, but existed long before in an almost entirely separate world, before the Great Drought essentially wiped the world clean. An entire civilization was built up, and then the world reset... everything started over from nothing.
// wodsnick_4 6
!i %%pic%Snickwad%%Still more shocking were the archeological records we found and translated in Karavold. Around the time of the drought, they had experienced a revelation quite parallel to our own: another civilization, still older yet, had been consumed completely by a Great Flood.
%%pic%Snickwad%%We can't be certain, but there appears to be a cycle: drought, flood, drought, flood. Every time the civilizations begin to reach a state of technological advancement the end comes--whether by water or lack thereof.
// wodsnick_5 8
%%pic%Snickwad%%The end seems to be signaled by the appearance of 3 huge creatures: the Geomes. These creatures act as harbingers... bringing about the apocalypse. We don't know how these creatures could cause these worldwide catastrophes, but we do know that Karavold fought the creatures, but only defeated 2 of the 3. And then they were overtaken by drought.
// hist_1 9
!i %%pic%Snickwad%%We now believe that our only hope is to destroy all of the Geomes before they bring about the next great flood, which will wipe out civilization as we know it.
!i %%aliph%%This... this is unbelievable! The Geomes are here to bring the apocalypse??
!i %%pic%Biggs%%Aliph... now you see why it is so important to continue. Why you must not give up! Cassidy and Paxton laid down their lives for this cause! We must avenge their deaths, and save all of mankind!
!i %%aliph%%Wait, so Paxton and Cassidy knew about this?
!i %%pic%Biggs%%Well... not exactly. We didn't say anything because we weren't yet certain that this was happening. There's much that we still don't know about the Geomes. But it's clear to us now that the signs are here. We had of course hoped that the previous civilization was wrong... but the signs are here. All the same, we must prevail... it is the only option we have!
!i %%aliph%%So... what... what do I do?
!i %%pic%Biggs%%Continue the work, Aliph. Drive off the Geomes from our Plants. We'll need all the energy we can store to power the central cannons in Whiteforge. With all of our Plants pumping energy simultaneously, the lasers should have enough power to destroy the Geomes. It's our only hope. If you drive the Geomes off from the outer Plants, we predict that they will eventually attack Whiteforge, and here we will make our final stand and destroy them once and for all!
!i %%aliph%%So... I just need to continue on...
!i %%pic%Biggs%%For Cassidy! For Paxton! ...For us all!
!i %%aliph%%I... okay. I can do it. I must do it!
!i %%pic%Biggs%%I knew it! I knew I was right to put my faith in you, Aliph! You've shouldered more of this burden than anyone should have to bear, but, you have always risen to the challenge! I'm very proud of you, Aliph.
!i %%aliph%%... Thank you, Mayor Biggs.

%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Your question is too broad to answer accurately, but it is correct that the Geomes' attacks are not random at a high level, in the sense of a dice roll being used to determine their targets.

!i %%aliph%%According to this document, the Karavoldish developed 3 types of explosive devices, each type targeting the chemical makeup of a specific Geome.

!i %%aliph%%No, the bombs are held in 3 different silos hidden throughout the outer continents, but I was able to find map fragments showing the location of each silo. I should be able to find the bombs and then bring them back home where we can plan our next move!
!i %%pic%Snickwad_Radio%% %%speaker%none%%Actually, we believe the Geomes are coming to you. Our sources saw them retreating East to the outer continents after the attack on Whiteforge. We believe they are currently recharging from their weakened state, so it would be an ideal time to strike. 
!i %%pic%Snickwad_Radio%% %%speaker%none%%Aliph, we need you to retrieve the bombs as quickly as possible then head directly to the Geomes. Their immense size should make them easy to spot from afar.

%%speaker%g%0%% %%im%% %%pic%Biggs_End%%A mistake! What do you mean, Aliph? We had to stop the flood at any cost!
%%aliph%% %%im%%I found out that the apocalypses are triggered by major energy imbalances! We need to reverse the direction of Light Energy flow between Whiteforge and the Plants as quickly as possible!

%%speaker%g%0%% %%im%% %%pic%Biggs_End%%I'm afraid we can't do that, Aliph.

%%speaker%g%0%% %%im%% %%pic%Biggs_End%%If the flood is coming, then... at least some of us might be able to survive. We just need to focus all of our Light Energy into raising up Whiteforge.
%%aliph%% %%im%%This isn't Whiteforge! Not all of it! Only the Apex District! Besides, this is the opposite of what we need! Didn't you hear me? We need to send the Light Energy back out! The way things are now... will only ensure the coming of the flood!

%%aliph%% %%im%%...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%The flood... it's beginning to swallow up the horizon. We don't have long now...
//<Yara and Aliph are h	uddled together, Humus is nearby. They are outside, watching the water come> 
%%aliph%% %%im%%We should have seen it coming.
%%aliph%% %%im%%I should have seen it coming.
%%aliph%% %%im%%Whiteforge, the light energy, the imbalance... our civilization was corrupted by power. Is that it, Humus? We became greedy and exploitative, and this... this is our punishment.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Perhaps to some degree. But in many cases, power does not change people so much as it redefines the effects of their instincts.
%%aliph%% %%im%%What do you mean?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Let me put it this way... when a plant or animal is transferred to an environment where it has an abundance of resources, physical advantages, and/or a lack of predators, that species enters a position of relative power. It will garner an ever larger share of the environment's resources to the detriment of the environment's other inhabitants. Some humans call this an "invasive species".
%%aliph%% %%im%%Okay...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I think I get what Humus is saying. Maybe the problem isn't that powerful people are transformed by their power... maybe the problem is that they *aren't* transformed.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Humans are like any other creature: we do what we need to do to survive. But in our society, with our technology... some people exist in a space where immediate, physical concerns about things like food and shelter vanish completely. And yet they keep on exerting power and exerting power. They build giant floating towers like it's the only thing keeping them alive... even though that continues to be further and further from the truth!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%And that unnecessary exertion of power is destructive. Individual acts of violence are a necessary part of the struggle for survival and growth in any ecosystem... but as systems of power become more and more unbalanced, the violence of the powerful becomes less justifiable.
%%aliph%% %%im%%So it's all just inevitable then? No matter how many cycles of civilization pass, will people always just end up with destructive power structures like an invasive species? The way Humus describes it, it's just like clockwork... like we never had a choice. Like nothing matters. Like nobody is really right or wrong.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%I do experience the universe primarily as interlocking systems playing out. But remember this, Aliph: I too have a limited perspective in the face of the sheer complexity of existence.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I don't think we can ever really know what we have true control over, or what humans are capable of as a whole. And if we don't know... well, then there's some worth to fighting for things, even if they seem impossible. Or trying to think of different paths in the face of what feels inevitable.
%%aliph%% %%im%%But now... it's too late, right?! It's all so hopeless. Not just us... not just our lives. But Whiteforge. Everything. I mean maybe if we could write it all down for the next cycle of the world... but how? And what? There's not enough time! I've been spun around so many times over the past few weeks that everything is a blur. I don't know what's important anymore... what feelings to trust!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I know, Aliph. This is all too much to take in. But I have one idea... Humus.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Yes?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%%I have this feeling that you aren't as bound to this time and place as us. That you could survive the flood, or travel to places that we could never reach. Is that true?

%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%...
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%That is correct.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Well then... would you please... would you be interested in telling this story to other people? Other humans, or anyone else that could understand it? The story of Whiteforge, I mean. The story of Aliph, and... and Cassidy, and Mayor Biggs, and all of us.
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Hmmm...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Maybe if you told it to other people... people who had more time... they could make something more of all this than we could? Maybe everything we went through could all be more worthwhile, somehow?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I know you don't really care about the plans or fates of humans... but maybe it would at least be an interesting experience for you?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Well...
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Yes, I think that could be arranged.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Really? Do you promise?
%%speaker%g%1%% %%pic%Humus%% %%im%%Promise? Heh heh heh. Okay, yes, I promise.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%%Okay. Thank you, Humus.
//<silence for a few seconds> 11
%%aliph%% %%im%%I still can't believe everything I did... How could I have been so wrong?
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Come here, Aliph.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%Honestly? ...
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I don't think that you really *mattered* as much as you think you did. The flood was coming. Maybe you shifted the timing a little bit. But on a large scale? We just didn't get it. With or without you, we were headed for the flood. 
%%aliph%% %%im%%You shouldn't be comforting me. It's not right!
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%I know when you do something wrong... sometimes it feels like you have to pay by feeling bad enough somehow. Like that's justice. But... it's just not.
%%speaker%g%0%% %%pic%Yara%% %%im%%At this point... what else do we have besides comforting each other? You've been a friend to me, Aliph. You've made the last few weeks of my life better. And now? I just want you here, present with me... because I'm afraid.
%%aliph%% %%im%%...
%%aliph%% %%im%%Thank you, Yara.
%%aliph%% %%im%%You have been a better friend to me than I could ever ask for.
%%aliph%% %%im%%And thank you, Humus, for telling our story.
%%aliph%% %%im%%I guess this is it... the end...

%%aliph%%Yes. Yes, please.

this is a scrapped entity that basically forces the player to take a huge chunk of energy... the idea being that they have to prepare or play well in the section leading up to it to proceed. bad idea, well, at least it really doesnt fit with where we took the design
simpler tetris room
these are probably too cramped and hard bleh
also i should probably just use nostickwalls here lol
test room, not idea
test room, not idea
the shape of these simple mole rooms can be changed to fit a different context easily
introduce podswitch
lol tetris room
i dont think a big racey coursey thing works well here but would be good for maybe a side area running really fast with wind and ice and stuff
this area will be hidden, but there will be a tell on te right side 
mole podswitch basic
more complex mole podswitch
wraparound format to allow you to see mole path
more complex mole podswitch
fun switch antics
ignore this
start
start
start
not sure exactly how this will play out visually but basically theres like a secret passage and u have to go above to not block the laser
doors close right after u like youre in a cool movie1 basically u just have tonot try to climb up right next to the doors because then you wont make it
periodically stop pews
this implementation is too cramped,it will be expanded in final draft
simple fun thing, might add a bit of complication
failed attempt, idea to the right is better verion
attempt at a big room using basin focus ents, its a bit hard to use these kinds of things because seeing all the wire connections and laser positions is so important... but i think this is ok/
simple cover when vulnerable idea
gotta lock up the followlaser and avoid the switches so you dont release it
could probably be widened a bit
general idea here is that you can take cover on the left side when the followlasers switch but there seems to be weird bugs happening
down leads to an old, broken dead end... right continues to the gauntlet
this dreamer was originally going to give you the hint to find the red emerald marble, before the character didney was created
my partner throughout even the ocean developmnet, mo, realllllly loved the croissant kings animation heh
mo just moved out and i miss them a lot right now
ooh, this is a scrapped entity that automatically centered your energy bar... kind of went against what we were trying to communicate because it makes exact center seem like the best or most correct energy level... where as we wanted you to find whatever works for you
ooh yeah, so for a long time i wanted to make the nonstick walls be covered in slime and have a secret side area where you see that all the slime comes from some sort of snail creature... and you could see like a special home of all the snails where most of the walls are covered in slime
but it was just sort of a pain to think about that aesthetically fitting with all the different art across the game... so i just made the nonstick walls simpler and cleaner
you see this is almost where you just were, but now you can open up this door... i used to be really into this weird self overlapping level design... but now... it just seems fuzzy to me, id rather have clarity
here we are at the canyon gauntlet... hey youre remembering that you can use all the gameplay settings like turning off death or making energy effects milder, right... theres some toughh weird design in these old areas and i want you to have a good time and not a slog
heres a sorta scary unintuitive part where you have to go down and wrap around to almost where you just were
this was like an actual puzzle where you had to use the right combination of bubbles and switches to get all the gates open at once... but its broken now heh so just continue
uhhh i dunno why i made it seem like you needed to bring a bubble over here... i guess it was just to reduce gas damage along the way... theres no bubble switch
heres the boss room, but im having a hard time piecing together how this all was supposed to work... so i opened up the exit in the center back to the overworld...
congrats on finishing old canyon whooo
if you get a bunch of light energy and jump directly up right here you find a secret path to the red emerald marble
i dont really remember where in this coming area the marble actually was...
calluna was originally named moonderful and was a lot more wacky and contrarian in a roald dahl character sort of way
and while theres nothing wrong with being wacky, as the tone of the game generally grew more realistic and less dreamlike, i wanted to make sure that this character didnt seem like they were being made fun of by the game... i wanted them to come across as gentle and sensitive as they were in my mind to a more casual observer
this moon mural is one of the last vestiges of dan fesslers hd index painting pixel art technique ...
its a really neat photoshop technique where you use adjustment layers in photoshop to paint with normal hd brushes and have it sort of be instantly converted to pixel art... i tried it for a while before simply using hd art..., well nonpixel art that is
this secret area was going to contain an item similar to the red emerald marble, but like a scary version that would allow you to go through a nearby area themed after nightmares... so it would be like the negative version of dreamdram
this is the part where you were going to use a flight dream to climb over the dangerous path so you can continue on to the gauntlet... but just climb up and over hehe
lol this was going to be a... adult... dream room... before we decided to make even the ocean an all ages game
we lost very little by cutting out a few swears, but i thinkn gained a lot by making it pretty thematically safe... id really like for youth to be able to play even the ocean and maybe be exposed to some interesting themes and have that sort of special engagement that only kids can have with media
silly fun  cld have bigger room
atmosphere not hard-smashhandtiles could be easy setting blocks
allows you to get out if bubble pops, also a shortcut if you have max light. not sure if shortcuts are just confusing though
this long part incentivizes unbalance--lit allows jumping to the cloud tiles, dark allows some fun fastrunning
we tend to design too small making things finicky, do u think this expanded version of left is better
more space also makes the shifting energy effects more meaningful
outdoor section to give nice feeling of scaling the cliff
appears to be a dead end but you can sneak into this rocky passageway
open spaces become paths via bubble
travelling up u want to be pressed into the wall by the lasers
scary thrilling fall that is not actually that dangerous
cloud tiles give more vert control for interesting energy control thru gas
basic vert lego
2 puzzles in 1
canyon is one of the few areas that got to a pretty finished state in the all pixel art style... more commentary on why we didnt go forward with that in shore
timing into the revolvespores
trying to reward careful downwards motion
dramatic introducin to ghost powered doors... you seem trapped
ignore
start
have to get it into middle path
a bunch of racetrack like stuff, trying to be fluid motion
start
take care of shield direction to avoid danger
basic wallpusher learning
big climb, just need to stay on your toes
the pushers can slide you across the ice, wheee
hardish but pretty safe jump
simple bubble water interactions, you can be flung all the way up to the switch if you swim deep and let the water push you up
simple squishbounce use
trap the squishy, well u can do it without trapping but its pretty hard
just open the door while dealing with the pusher
test idea, ignore
ehh dont really like how this works out
simple smashhand with some flexibility in path

i think this area was going to be sorta secret and lead to dolores hideout
oscar basin used to have a flag, portraying two hands holding a heart aloft
and dolores was going to be displaying the flag upside down so that it  looked like a terrified or sad face... i sketched this out in tiles above
this sap pad was for turning off the barbed wire
welcome to basin power plant... the idea of this area was that you go down this central shaft , branching out into side areas and then coming back... turning off barbed wires as you go... then you bring a bubble all llll the way back up to that switch to the right where you go to redirect the gas
but i just left that door open on the right because we removed the ability to turn off barbed wire... theres nothing really over there, if you want to experience the power plant just head left here
awww, this parachuting part is not really tight design but its kinda fun isnt it
every good game requires a racing minigame lol
this was gonna lead to some terminal where you redirect gas, but its a dead end
this idea is broken because we changed the behaviour of followlaser... i think it used to not track you as perfectly... so you could sort of get around with the bubble, open that door and then use the followlaser on the conducting orb
another day, another mole race
i like the gist of this idea, but it didnt quite gel... it was annoying to have to wait for all the slow shots t disappear before stepping on the sap pad
this idea is bad, it relies on the player having knowledge that they cant have... basically the mole is a timer that opens up that purple vent which makes it harder to bring a bubble over... but its not really clear you need to bring a bubble until its probably too late
ehhh these ideas are broken, just continue down here and be on your way
welcome to the forest boss room, this area actually has some pretty neat...but too finicky... design in it
we cut rotational crystal lenses from the final game, so theres no proper art for the receptors... so i just drew these blue lines that will guide you where you need to take them
when youve placed enough crystal lenses, exit here
note i added some tile up here so that during wilbert u can see the bugs
debug
hehe i guess thats all we have of that older draft, heres a newer one , look its the entryway bubble puzzle again..., but slightly different
uh oh, a dead end ahead... hey whats this litttle draft of wind above me
omg whaaaaat i bet u didnt even know these things could rotate
but because aliph can only shield in four exact directions... its very hard to tell if these rotating things will hit... too confusing
this is the old boss room, but a lot of the ideas are broken... you can look  at them and then just go through this door when youre done
wind pushing you towards pods simple
u can kind of just run thru, but might want to open up to get hit by the pews if the gas overtakes u

there are main paths for each but u can take the wrong path in all cases

the lower path is mainly for travelling back but if you have trouble with the end of the top path its actually pretty easy to brute force dropping to the lower path

originally we were going to make it where you really could petrify the starfish with the gorgon seed, but we thought it took things to the wrong space
there was going to be a secret sidequest elsewhere where you could find ssome kind of medicine to fix the petrification if you felt bad... it was overcomplicated

basic spike presented as danger then utility
this could be done without the walkblocks but they add a sense of life to the challenge of the spikes
fastest way is to wall slide on the spike but u can do other things too

we used a few different methods of task organization over the years we worked on even the ocean... but as time went on we gravitated towards just using bullet points on simple shared documents... as well as email and occasionally live chat
heres a peek at one of my photoshop documents... the main nature art process involved drawing silhouettes of the main shapes on different layers with the lasso tool..., checking to see if the silhouette version felt good in game, then filling in the silhouettes with shading and texture
almost all the effects animation in even the ocean is just 2 looping textures on top of each other, scrolling at different speeds
its generally considered a negative to have low resolution art, at least if its not pixel art... painting low res backgrounds is sort of funny... but it was a speedy and satisfying process for me, and i think the transitions between the nature areas and the power plants and the overall aesthetic cohesion of the game maybe can encourage people to be a bit less strict about defining the boundaries of techniques
find a process that works for you and run with it... doesnt matter if its imperfect... everything is imperfect

i made this passage so you can see whats ahead but it looks like a happy face
at one point i really wanted to make the levels fit the shapes of the creatures
like right now we are standing on the tail of the sea geome... well we used to call them golems
it didnt have that much effect on the experience however, and really hampered the design process... so we cut that... the final geome level design has nothing to do with the shape of the creature
we cut these gas blower entities because everything they did was handled better by wind or geysers
look, youre back at the beginning of the geome... you can jump over this final spike if you want to get back where you were before... or you could just go through this door right here to go back to the map
now youre outside on the back of the geome... we imagined this as a sort of escape sequence, where you plant the bombs and then have to run along the outside of the geome
to the left are the big spines on the back of the geome
you made it to the head of the sea geome... just an empty room currently, follow the path to continue on
this puzzle was unnecessarily elaborate and got broken at some point, so just keep heading right to enter the shoreplace powerplant, yay
as you can see, restview beach was one of the most visually complete areas in the old pixel art style... while it looks ok, there were a few things that made me not want to progress in this way
the main problem was that, in the nature areas, i was constantly fighting the smallness and regularity of the grid
the geometry of the nature areas was not meant to be parsed into a grid by the players mind, i wanted them to be able to feel a wider variety of size and shape in the rocks, trees, etc
so it was much easier to achieve those feelings by just drawing the areas as big images
on the other hand, for the power plants,  the design being parsed as a grid was a positive thing... it clarified the ideas and helped the player plan their motion
the power plants were also much longer and more intricately shaped, so it was ideal to use pixel art tiles for those
uhhh, i added this weird sticking out part because putting the lens in the receptor while underwater was broken... but like you dont have to do this lol
hooo boy that was rough
you found a seeecret area, can you get to the secret itom on the right
going off the map didnt used to kill you, heh, we ended up removing these sorts of secrets from eto... we wanted to focus our development time and energy and the players attention on the nuance within the main poath
secrets can be fun but unless theyre really well designed theyre kind of just a chore where you have to hug the wall of every mapp... and also it didnt really fit into the story and themes of eto, so it was a good cut

the purpose of the camera lock is to show the player they arent missing anything on the lower path so if they just make the jump they wont be tempteted to check if they missed something

so this idea is really complicated, but technically doable
the key is the three blue squares, bounce the laser left from the first blue square while wallsliding, then bounce it left again from the second blue square while jumping, then bounce it one last time at the third blue square with your shield pointing down and jumping
or just turn off the gates lol
sorry
the starfish was an old idea, and fits sort of funnily into the final game... a bit more fantastical than most parts
early on, aliphs adventures were meant to be more like anodyne, an anything goes dreamworld
but i liked the character, atmosphere, and interacitions around the starfish, so we kept it
wow a branching path... pretty cool right, did you go right or left
we realized that this sort of branching was actually not that interesting, so instead we tried to design primarily linear challenges that could be surmounted in a gradation of ways
we wanted you to think, how will i approach this challenge, not, what am i missing on the other side
lol whys this room so big... looks like a job for triple speed mode
congrats on completing old hill gauntlet, this tunnel will take you back to the overworld
ah i remember this, heres the entrance to the hill power plant with acool puzzle to teach about bubble switches
interesting use of sap pads as obstacle only... precursor to the energized floors from some of the geomes perhaps...
poor spikes... once a fixture of eto level design, the finished game only has one i believe
early design had a lot of stuff like these ceiling bumps that are basically just there to mess with what would otherwise be an ideal path
but ultimately i think its better to try to create satisfying paths of motion and let the difficulty come in naturally from player error or inevitable fuzziness of communication between the mind of the designer and the player through the levels
i remember trying to tune this idea just right so you could block some shots then quickly jump to get a bubble and jump backso that you wouldnt have to go around... kind of silly
gee whiz this pair of ideas is a nightmarescape, you need to bring back a bubble from each side to get through these two sets of doors
i think some slight control changes since i designed these might make things a bit harder but mostly its just bad design, remember you can turn off doors in the gameplay options

SCENE db
%%name%Recorded Message%%Hey... hey there! It's me. No, not Humus... it's Melos! Melos Han-Tani. I made this game with Marina Kittaka. Gee whiz, I'm in Kyoto right now, 2016, July typing this. I just got some money from the 7-11. My girlfriend Sandy is working on some Classical Japanese in front of me. Heh, if you're reading this, I guess we finished the game, huh? That's really great. Boy it was kind of scary all these years... but somehow, Marina and I, we did it. Anyways... I hope you liked it. There's still more I want to show you. Why don't you come all the way to the Northern Outer Continent, and see if you can find a statue? I'll see you there!
%%name%Recorded Message%%So, ahead, well, I suppose that's where I'll part. Ahead, I used to hide items. But I think it'll be more enjoyable if I just remove the items. So, I did. What is ahead... ? Well, if you just played Even the Ocean... you can call this "The Old Ocean". A long time ago... actually, just two years - Even the Ocean was going to be two games. What you're about to enter is, well, what was going to be "The Ocean". The plot would roughly follow what Even the Ocean is - an adventure going to six Power Plants, then, three Great Beasts, even the ends of the earth. I hope you enjoy what you'll find in The Old Ocean, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me (outside of this game.)
%%name%Recorded Message%%Agh, it's as I imagined, he wants to go to the Secret Ocean! Ah, I don't want to be stuck there. You, whoever you are! Find us!
%%name%Recorded Message%%Nooo!!!
// 4	
%%speaker%none%%Ahead is the SECRET OCEAN. You would need two items to progress: The everwet and everdry stone, located at the ends of the earth in Act 5. If you'd like, you can disallow yourself from going beyond here until you find them.
!i %%speaker%none%%Hey, these are tips from me, Melos! (One of the devs...). Ahead is the post-game. Here are some tips. 1. There are no items to collect - any you might run into are debug items and well... they don't do anything (really). Maybe they'll glitch your inventory in a bad way. They're a holdover from when you used to get items based on how well you finished levels, and then use them to plant a garden in a Greenhouse.
!i %%speaker%none%%2. I'd make a rough map if I were you, so you can navigate. There are no maps provided.
!i %%speaker%none%%3. Keep a backup save or two... just in case. I didn't have time to make sure you can't get stuck in the areas ahead. You can make use of the Post-ending Warp in the menu.
!i %%speaker%none%%4. Make use of the triple-speed option when needed if you seem stuck.
!i %%speaker%none%%5. In the world maps, follow the grey paths to get to the areas.
!i %%speaker%none%%6. You might see signposts here and there: they were placeholders for where I envisioned NPCs to be. They all say the same thing... heh.
!i %%speaker%none%%7. Leave Even the Ocean a positive review... heh heh heh!
%%speaker%none%%8. Most of these areas use debug tiles, so I've used the correct songs when possible so you know which area a place used to be.
// 13
%%speaker%none%%Act 1 begins here, with Aliph in the red, Stone Forest... this became Fay Rouge in the final game.
%%speaker%none%%Old Dreamdram Canyon and Restview Beach this way! These are part of Act 2.
%%speaker%none%%ACT 3 OF THE OLD OCEAN: Aliph must accomplish something by visiting power plants in a river town, a snowy valley and dark, autumn time woods... 
%%speaker%none%%This way to Act 3 and beyond.
%%speaker%none%%This way to SINKHOLE CITY (unofficial name... just thought of this now...), where Aliph visits throughout her quest in The Old Ocean, at the end of ACT 5 and a few times before. The end of the game was supposed to take place here for some reason. You might find secrets here...
// 18
%%speaker%none%%From here on, is an arranged version of old Even the Ocean levels, which I'm calling 'The Old Ocean'. It, like ETO, is split into 5 Acts. I've left some NPCs here and there to tell you roughly where each of the 5 acts would take place.
%%speaker%none%%South of here is Act 4. To get here, you go through an old version of Karst Pass.
// 20
%%speaker%none%%Through here is Act 5. In this act, aliph goes to the north and south ends of the world, and gets to see beyond.
%%speaker%none%%When arranging the postgame in 2015, I originally required you to collect 7 orb items before this gate opened, but got rid of the idea. If you'd like, you can impose a restriction on yourself and try to get to the end of the previous 7 areas. Anyways, this is the old version of Karst Pass. Up ahead are some areas related to Jane, who was originally an artist building a strange building.
%%speaker%none%%Right here is "The Quarry", a place where you would have gotten rocks for (old) Jane. Instead it'll lead you to the Act 4 of The Old Ocean. To the left is Jane's building, which has  a basement and other rooms which would have held dialogue/items/etc.
%%speaker%none%%Again, here I required you to get to the ends of the three Great Beasts to go through this gate. Feel free to impose this restriction on yourself if you'd like. This passage is called The White Tunnel - an underwater cavern with White Stone.
%%speaker%none%%Here Aliph would get to see what's above the Great Falls.
// 25
%%speaker%none%% %%yn%Stone Forest (???)%26%Hub%27%Motion Demo Hub%28%Never mind%-1%%Welcome to the House of Old Gauntlets. What do you want to learn about?
%%speaker%none%%This was originally one of the starting areas of the game. Instead, it later became a preview level for Pax Prime in 2013. There are two "test" levels connected to this area, one made by Melos and one by Marina. Can you guess who made each level?
%%speaker%none%%This was the original hub for some sort of demo. It served the same function as the Motion Demo Hub, which is why you can't access any other areas from this hub. There are also "animals" here, which we at one point wanted to add to the game.
%%speaker%none%%We sent out a build of the game for free in early 2014 featuring this hub, which connected to a few preview areas. Of note is the early Canyon tileset.
//29
%%speaker%none%%This is the House of NPCs. Each room is a test room for the main areas of the game. I used these rooms to test NPC events, etc., before the final areas' structures were done.
%%speaker%none%%This is the House of Gauntlet Rooms. Each door leads to a 'testing area' where we would design each part of the final levels in isolation before I (Melos) arranged them into their near-final forms.
%%speaker%none%%One of these maps is just a tiling test I made, another is a map I made with the help of a Twitch Stream. The others are "Even" maps, from when the game was Even *and* The Ocean. Even was a game in a dream world and the "real world" where you would walk slowly in real life places, and go into daydreams with weird physics conditions. Also it had a world map. Most of the Even maps here are broken in some way.
%%speaker%none%%These are misc. tests, from small size rooms, to camera testing, to random Marina tests, to jump physics testing rooms.
%%speaker%none%%Up and down are Melos's testing rooms for various debugging he had to do.
//34
%%speaker%none%%I used to have me and Marina captive here, and there was a guy you could give OceanBucks codes to (if you remember that...). There are no things related to OceanBucks in the game anymore, unfortuantely.
%%speaker%none%%When there are [ ] around a map name, that's the area's name in the final game.
%%speaker%none%%Boreas Heights this way!
%%speaker%none%%Whoops, nothing here.
// 38
%%speaker%none%%Above are the silos. They were never in the original vision of the game but I wanted to include our first drafts somehow.
%%speaker%none%%I changed the code for Wires, which basically broke the graphical aspect of all of the wires in the post-game. Luckily it doesn't crash the game!
//40
%%speaker%none%%Uh, so this place is really confusing because areas used to be designed around finding items. More on that soon..
%%speaker%none%%Here's a shortcut to the *end* of the Power Plant.
%%speaker%none%%You'll notice this place branches a lot - I was trying to really give 'depth' to the area via adding tunnels, secret paths, linking things together - think the castle of Kirby Super Star's Great Cave Offensive. But we ended up scrapping items and shifting design goals towards something simpler, so this style never really stuck.
%%speaker%none%%I'm pretty sure I was inspired by the Crystal Mine section of Kirby Super Star's Great Cave Offensive here - where you pop into a new room and it's a path you viewed from another room. I find this approach to be neat, but easily becomes disorienting.
%%speaker%none%%That yellow square is what used to be an item (... don't collect it, really!). You'll notice it's in a weird spot - I used to place items in ways you had to climb or swim out of bounds to reach. Part of why we scrapped items/secrets is that I became more interested in more clear communication vs. secrets, which have a tendency to add this layer of mystery to things which I may not want interfering with my intended themes/ideas for the game.
//45
%%speaker%none%%I originally wanted the world map to have lots of hidden areas, and things connect in neat ways, like Super Mario World. This made less sense as I went along and we developed a story - side areas started to feel more confusing or like distractions.
%%speaker%none%%I find this map to be architecturally interesting still - I still like a lot of these maps I designed, just, again, didn't fit in the final ETO. Here you would talk to some NPC mom about her child running around the beach or something. You'd get an item, and uh, yeah...
%%speaker%none%%You can't get there, but the launch spore up there shoots you to a floating platform. I had this really weird idea for some secret post-game stuff where you have to go out of bounds in each area in certain ways, but those sorts of weird secrets and spaces made less sense as ETO's story grew stronger... not that I'm not interested in surreal secrets stuff, but it didn't seem to fit with ETO anymore.
%%speaker%none%%Heh, to the left takes you back to the beach area. Kind of cute, right? Also, we never used these energy-slime-drop entities in the final game. More of an obstacle than something that interesting from a motion-manipulating standpoint.
%%speaker%none%%Hehe, you found this! I do this a few other times in the old Restview, but since this was one of the areas we took the 'furthest' in the old style, you don't really see these kinds of secrets in other old areas.
// 50
%%speaker%none%%Whoa, so much of this is nostalgic - as you might tell, the Shore Power Plant was designed much more with a predetermined image in my head, with various setpieces in mind (a huge, downwards cave, like here, etc.) Ultimately we didn't go with this, because it was hard to make levels that worked well with the energy mechanic... and the levels ended up sacrificing legibility/space to move for 'cool area ideas'. I still think it would be fun to do a platformer with stuff like this, but who knows if it would be good or not. It would probably be much different than ETO.
%%speaker%none%%Phew, jeez, that was really something tough, huh? You may have noticed swimming played a minimal role in ETO, well, that's because there's only so much that really worked with it. It's kind of an awkward motion to control.
%%speaker%none%%Heh heh, look what's still sitting here! Anyways, this is the original Boreas. Like Shore, I mostly worked from ideas rather than good design... so there's this cool 'hill climbing' setpiece but it's kind of difficult. Still it's a little cool. That big white square was supposed to be a moving gas cloud.
%%speaker%none%%This room was supposed to be the "side" of a hill you would scale. With a big gas field below. Eh... cool in theory but kind of tedious in practice.
%%speaker%none%%So much vertical design.... whoaaaa! Wind used to be more extreme.
// 55
%%speaker%none%%This was like, the top of a hill. With cool wind things and what not. Eh...
%%speaker%none%%Whoa whoa! Two big things! 1. There's a new TRIPLE SPEED and MINI-MAPS gameplay option to try out, and 2. Don't forget to talk to all of Marina's messages, too! Like the one to the right of me.
%%speaker%none%%Welcome to old Riverton! Originally this was going to be in the middle of some tall woods and treetops - think sort of a darker ambience, a little more downtempo. This is an extremely confusing area - you might want to use the minimap. You'll see a few entities around here we never used in the final game.
%%speaker%none%%Ever play Maple Story? That game used to hide doors in places. I wanted to do that here. It's kind of a confusing thing now that I think about it, and would probably not have been great in a game as stripped down as Even the Ocean.
%%speaker%none%%I like how all these bridges and house-on-stilt-like structures just stack on each other. It's confusing as heck, but neat. There were supposed to be many people in Riverton!
//60
%%speaker%none%%Confusing, right? Well, this door here goes to the *EXIT* of the Power Plant. Weird!!! To the top-left and bottom-left of here are two different maps.
%%speaker%none%%Something I really like about this... it was supposed to be a leafy, wooded path behind Riverton to the power plant. You go inside and can't get to the core (heh) so you have to find another way!
%%speaker%none%%That's it for old Riverton. This'll take you to Act 4 and beyond.
%%speaker%none%%To add another layer of confusion... this used to be a door going back to that tree-tops area.
%%speaker%none%%The NPC sequence here used to be helping out a Fungus stop growing to open the way back to the Power Plant... how silly! Anyways, that's where little storeroom where Gatekeeper sleeps came from. To the bottom left is the entrance to the Fungus.
// 65
%%speaker%none%%You're supposed to go further into the Fungus to activate some receptors to open these gates, but some code changed so they don't work anymore. You can still go to the right to see the rest of the Fungus if you want.
%%speaker%none%%Heh these things are hard and broken now.
%%speaker%none%%This is the power plant. This is a hilariously confusing map. you need to get to a door below this sign.
%%speaker%none%%I still made some room designs like this, where you have to traverse to multiple buttons. It's a little annoying though so I used it less in the final game.
%%speaker%none%%This is kind of a cool room. It's like a freeform playground you can make your way to the top in any way.
// 70
%%speaker%none%%It just keeps going!! This is a little big open cavern place.
%%speaker%none%%Lol this is hard. You can use float mode or whatever
%%speaker%none%%Paxton nooo!!! This is the core. You can leave through the left or see the old ideas above. You used to need to activate four vents.
%%speaker%none%%This area is nuts... it's a bunch of scaffolding in the treetops. Meant to be partially a construction site, I believe the storeroom was also here with the guard (which became a bunch of characters in Riverton).
%%speaker%none%%I believe the boat characters, one of them was meant to be here instead, and they were actually a construction worker.
// 75
%%speaker%none%%This is old Magdal woods. Another confusing place. Above is where a hidden item used to be, you have to fall down from a map above.
%%speaker%none%%Lots of items were scattered around here. I believe the power plant is to the right, more weird stuff above.
%%speaker%none%%Power Plant's to the right. This was like... a tree interior I believe? Something weird.
%%speaker%none%%This was a courtyard of some sorts. With items, etc. Used to go to the world map somewhere, but no longer.
%%speaker%none%%This power plant seems relatively not impossible so far! Here's a weird structure twist... this one loops around to an exit near the entrance.
// 80
%%speaker%none%%Another weird room. Some power plant cores ended up like this - where you have to finish two receptor things to open up a door.
%%speaker%none%%So, you had to actually come here twice through different paths, and got to only do one side at a time. You had to push down and ride the eye-block spore things to these slots on the bottom to power something up! This is broken now. Just go upwards.
%%speaker%none%%A cool tree-tops area with strong wind and hard hidden items (which I removed). So many spike traps heh. Spikes are like... I don't know, not that interesting to me. So extreme and control your movement so much.
%%speaker%none%%Ha, a bear NPC that survived development. Doesn't talk, though. You can actually get all the way to the right... it's a shortcut to the courtyard. Or something.
%%speaker%none%%This is the White Desert, a place that was meant to separate you from the Earth Geome. This is just something I sketched up real fast, not something that was ever planned for the game.
// 85
%%speaker%none%%I like this area, actually. The Global Wind really works well here, though it might be annoying here!
%%speaker%none%%I like how expressive particles can be. Most particles in this game use the same system where I just set the velocities and some other parameters, like color, etc.
%%speaker%none%%You had to actually climb INTO the Earth Geome here!
%%speaker%none%%I like this little antechamber and place a lot, though it's kind of meh and confusing shaped. Reminds me of the start of 3D Zelda dungeons... anticipation! There's a lot of atmospheric places in this map, like the two chambers above, or the weird big space with lots of bouncing things.
%%speaker%none%%This is kind of weird and complicated. I think one of my design weaknesses early on was working more from 'cool ideas' and not really thinking about how they would play or feel overall.
//90
%%speaker%none%%The idea here was you're travelling through the back of the Geome and can see outside. I always like these little rooms that kind of hint at the structure of an area. The upcoming maps have a bunch of hard and weird ideas... hopefully you'll survive!
%%speaker%none%%This area was *outside* of the Geome, with wind pushing you and stuff.
%%speaker%none%%You can leave through the left. This area might not be finishable, who knows!
%%speaker%none%%I called this place "The Shallow Land"... like a bunch of little swamps and puddles and stuff. For some reason the Sea Geome is in the center. Kind of a neat image in my head, though.
%%speaker%none%%Re: that thing Marina said, the Geomes level layout still kind of fits that of the actual creature, but on a granular level, yeah, not at all. Except in some cases like the start of the Air and Earth Geomes.
// 95
%%speaker%none%%Whoa cool right? Underground lake thing!
%%speaker%none%%I am the Sea Geome!!!!
%%speaker%none%%I was imagining here you'd climb this giant rock like in Golden Sun 2 and then go inside to somehow make it to the Air Geome. I guess we kind of do that in Great Cliff.
%%speaker%none%%Whoaaa a boring maze! Go to the right.
%%speaker%none%%It's the AIR GEOME!!! Neat...
// 100
%%speaker%none%%I still think this area is really cool... twisting neural passageways and spooky music. It's just really hard.
%%speaker%none%%This place is cool too! Going outside under the stomach of the Air Geome, making your way through these big open spaces. Ultimately... well this has kind of been a theme of a lot of my early level design - unfriendly, high-concept-based. I think you really need to have the right game to make this stuff *work*. Even the Ocean went a different direction so this stuff made less sense. I think it would be fun to do a platformer with stuff like this, maybe a little better designed though.
%%speaker%none%%OK, so this place was REALLY confusing before but the idea is that you used to be able to save the state of those raise-walls powered by energy. So I was able to make it so you can choose from 3 rooms to go to, and beat them in any order, in order to unlock the path forward. But I just made it linear for the postgame.
%%speaker%none%%Ha ha, metroid throwback
%%speaker%none%%This was a callback to some place in Metroid Prime 2... where u launch across huge canyons as shortcuts on the way back.
// 105
%%speaker%none%%This is the original Great Cliff, which came at the end of the game (and over development, was, and wasn't a part of a Geome area). It's REALLY precarious and has goofy geometry... weird impossible rocks, etc.
%%speaker%none%%Used to be an item around here! Secrets!!!
%%speaker%none%%Feel familiar??? This is the original cliff edge... which u fall down and go onwards to a Town with mysterious people or something. U can actually take a shortcut upwards here, but it doesn't go anywhere anymore.
%%speaker%none%%This town is pretty empty and confusing, but there's only one other way out at the top. There used to be a puzzle here by which you would learn how to get into the Air Geome or something.
%%speaker%none%%This used to come earlier in the area. Straight shoot up. Another wacky level geometry idea...that's still really cool!!
//110
%%speaker%none%%At some point you'd board the air geome here... but I just made this the edge of the world. Go down!
%%speaker%none%%Nothing down here, but this is the DEEPEST POINT IN EVEN THE OCEAN!!! As in the hardest to work your way back to the normal game, maybe... unless u warp.

%%speaker%none%%Yeah, this is like, Canyon draft 2 or something. Heh. A lot of similar structure and layout.
%%speaker%none%%Ooh I'm getting nostalgic, this is from when we used to stick mini-levels inside of the non-power-plant areas. I too have no idea where the REM was. I think by working on Canyon we realized that tiling by hand is insane so I coded up an autotiler for use in power plants.
%%speaker%none%%God I hate these stupid pendulum things lol. They always broke or crashed in some weird way because of the dumb physics I coded for them. I guess they're cool in the end though.
%%speaker%none%%There used to be a dreamer planned for here that dreamed about the Geome and it would make a sound when you talked to it.

%%speaker%none%%Here's the old city. used to be on the side of a sinkhole. to the left is old whiteforge. weird seeing this stuff... whiteforge was interesting .used to be bigger but we scaled back for obvious reasons. i added in the library/museum relatively late, cuz i wanted to write some fun words for the game.
%%speaker%none%%spooky tower ! i like weird spooky abstract tower spaces like this a lot. games are cool
%%speaker%none%%used to enter areas more like in murex park. scrapped that for the train which meant less graphics ands impler flow. these floating signposts are event triggers that have been deactivated. there's not much else to see in this city area - i'd move on to the rest of the old ocean or secret ocean

There used to be a bigger community here in these woods but the population shifted towards more industrialized environments. Perhaps we should have moved along with them, but at this point... it feels to me like this library is a part of the woods. I don't know if it could be transplanted. We have an inter-library loan program and the building itself is still frequented by those with a love of books and a bit of a penchant for adventure.

!i %%aliph%%And they just left you here??
!i %%pic%Jane%%I chose to stay. I knew my life's work was here in these outer continents. Initially I kept in pretty regular contact with Whiteforge via the Karavold radio system. But eventually they stopped showing interest in my updates, and I started working further and further away from Karavold. I suppose the work has always been enough for me. Even if there doesn't seem to be much of a point or greater impact.
!i %%aliph%%Yeah... hmm...
!i %%aliph%%Wait a minute, this is reminding me of a conversation I had with Wodsnick when I first learned about Karavold...
!i %%pic%Jane%%Wodsnick, eh? I remember Anatol Wodsnick as a dead serious, baby-faced kid, but I guess now he must be an old fart like me.
!i %%aliph%%Yeah... he said that the expeditions were cut short because of what they learned about the Geomes having attacked Karavold... they focused on domestic infrastructure and defense in the hopes that they'd be able to defend against the Geomes if Whiteforge was attacked.
!i %%pic%Jane%%What?? Why that little...
!i %%pic%Jane%%Hmph!... Men and their grand schemes... I knew something was going on that they weren't telling us. So those were the "budget redistributions". It's all making more sense now... Karavold's destruction must've spooked the leadership team. But instead of trying to learn more, they just retreated to what they know best... towers and guns.
!i %%pic%Jane%%You know, Aliph, I used to think they really cared about understanding the natural world. I used to think everyone cared! We're all of part of it, we're all interconnected with everything! But the more I tried to get people to understand my work and its relevance... the more I realized people don't really see it that way. To a lot of people... everything that's not the City is "Nature". Some monolithic and exotic ideal... good for a vacation, scary when it acts up. If they'd let me have my say, I'd have... well... I guess they didn't, and there's no point in me taking *your* head off over it...
!i %%aliph%%Not at all! I mean... I wish you had been in on some of those earlier conversations! Maybe you could have helped. Maybe we wouldn't be in this situation now...
!i %%pic%Jane%%Ah well... I appreciate the sentiment, kid. 
!i %%pic%Jane%%Oh! Looks like you'd better get in position to jump soon. Geome's rounding the bend. Hope you make it through this safe. And, ah... if you have got the time... stop by before you leave.
%%aliph%%Yeah, of course! I'll stop by. Thanks, Jane.

!i %%aliph%%Yeah, well, somehow I made it. I'm just glad it's done.
!i %%pic%Jane%%That's good, Aliph. Though, it was truly a pity that it had to be done. By the way, Aliph. If I'm right in thinking... the tunnel to Whiteforge is active now, correct?
!i %%aliph%%Yeah... for now, at least. Do you... do you want to go back?
!i %%pic%Jane%%Ah... I know I'm getting old. And... it would be the "right" thing to do to go back... tie up some loose ends. But I think it's a bit too much to face after all these years. It'll be a whole different world. And out here... this is my home now. I still have plenty of work left! 
!i %%pic%Jane%%But... ah... Aliph.
!i %%aliph%%Yes?
!i %%pic%Jane%%Do you think you could bring this data card back to Whiteforge? It contains most of my sketches, notes, charts, et cetera. Maybe it'll be of use, you know, when I'm gone. Outer Continent settlement sure seems like a possibility if you're around knocking off Geomes at this rate.

SCENE fieldguide_desc
Standing on this shifts my energy towards the color on top of the pad, and sends the opposite type to whatever it's hooked up to.
If energized, these gates will change position. There's usually a Sap Pad nearby to power it.
These plant pods absorb energy from the earth, and upon contact, will release it in a burst. Within moments, they'll recharge!
These exhaust vents spew loose energy in periodic bursts. I'll have to pay attention to the direction of my shield as I approach these hazards!
Energized gas that slowly changes my energy balance. It's slow-acting, but if you don't pay attention, the effects'll build up fast!
// 5
These dispense an oscillating crystal lens which can be used to repair receptors in the Power Plant cores. The lenses are fragile, and break when they contact any type of energy concentration.
Used in Power Plant machinery, these use crystal lenses to connect important, high-energy circuits.
Fast, convenient, vertical transportation.
These wires can conduct energy from one place to another.
This glass orb can absorb and conduct loose energy, powering any connected machinery.
// 10
I can jump upwards through these floors, walk on top of them, and then jump down through them.
Stepping on these buttons will send a pulse of energy to anything it's connected to.
If I touch one of these floating conveyer belts, it'll propel me upwards into the air.
These water geysers are harmless, and will push me upwards if I walk into them. If my shield is pointed against the flow, I might get pushed further...
These envelop me in a harmless energy bubble. The bubble will be popped by opposite color energies but it will shield me from some hazards of its own color.
// 15
If I run an energy bubble into one of these switches, it will send out a pulse of energy to any connected objects.
These lasers push me forcefully left and right. But perhaps the powerful energy flow could work to my advantage if I fall onto the beam with my shield facing downwards...
A dangerous, concentrated laser beam that tracks my motion. My shield can block the beam, but I'll have to keep a close lookout.
A patch of wind, which can aid or deter my movement. My shield can exaggerate its effect.
Smooth metal plating makes these walls impossible to climb.
// 20
These platforms extend in a direction when they detect pressure on top of them. They retract once the pressure is gone.
This spore will bounce back and forth between opposite walls. It releases energy if it touches something.
Dangerous, pointed and energized structures. I should try not to touch these.
A spore that will try and float towards me. It's deterred by light.
These lanterns repel Ghost Spores.
// 25
By climbing on the sides of these spores, I can push them to the left or right.
These mole creatures can absorb energy and then transport it to a remote location.
This spore can bounce me high if I jump off of it.
This block contracts and expands depending on the state of the toggle switches around it. I can climb on expanded blocks.
These switches toggle the Toggle Blocks around it.
// 30
When the floor is frozen, I will slide along it.
These panels will reflect shooting lasers.
This device fires short, harmful pulses of lasers. I can reflect them with my shield.
If the same-color shooting laser touches these blocks, they will disappear, sometimes only temporarily.
This floor material is energized, and will energize me just like loose gas.
// 35
These spores chase and try to harm me. I can jump on top of them and they'll bounce me upwards. My shield will repel them.
I can use these spores to launch me in any direction.
These objects seem to absorb Ghost Spores, and then transport energy into some connected device.
This plant pod will bounce me in the direction it points. They also release energy on contact.
This panel will lock my shield into a particular direction.
// 40
This panel will unlock my shield if it's been locked by a magnetizing panel.
These spores sit in walls, and try to bounce me away from the wall if I touch them.
These spores appear out of organic surfaces, and try to drop down onto me. I can stand or climb on them once they've hit the ground.
These spores harmlessly meander back and forth along walls and floors.
This spore, if it detects me, will extend quickly in a straight line, trying to smash me.
// 45
I'll keep notes here about the various things I run into while working.
