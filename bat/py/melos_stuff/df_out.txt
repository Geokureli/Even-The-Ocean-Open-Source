!i %%pic%Yara%%So Humus, what do you want out of life? You know, what do you want to do before you're gone?
!i %%pic%Humus%%Before I'm gone... you mean before my materials and/or consciousness are destabilized to an unrecognizable degree... nothing is necessary to me.
!i %%pic%Yara%%I can get that. Sometimes I feel like if I knew I was going soon, I would feel dissatisfied or a longing to have done more. But, I dunno...
!i %%pic%Yara%%It gets old, you know? The way you always have to prove that you're productive enough or valuable enough to deserve life and happiness. People always say that human dignity is inherent, and then turn around and deny it by measuring others up against their broken systems. Maybe it's just inevitable that things will end up this wapeople fighting to be on top and fighting to stay there.
!i %%pic%Yara%%I wonder if Karavold was like Whiteforge. Aliph said it existed in a whole different cycle of the world, right? Do you think there are more cycles? Do people just end up in the same terrible place over and over?
!i %%pic%Humus%%There were more cycles, but I don't remember them very well anymore.
!i %%pic%Yara%%Uh, what do you mean? You say that like you were there, hahaha! But no one could possibly... unless... Humus. Are you... not human?
!i %%pic%Humus%%That is correct, I am not human.
%%pic%Yara%%Whaaaaaat?
